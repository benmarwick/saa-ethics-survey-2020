"Principle 2: Accountability"
NA
NA
NA
"This considers accountability broadly - but does not take into account: 1) conflicting publics, 2) recognizing different power dynamics at multiple levels between archaeologist(s) and publics, or 3) what equity means in terms of \"beneficial\" to different parties."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I think this statement should be modified to recognize the agency of others. We are accountable not only to \"affected groups\" but to those concerned with heritage for different reasons and from different perspectives. Those whose interests are at odds with that of archaeology will demand a report, but we should be particularly assiduous in being accountable to those who share our interests and concerns."
NA
"What exactly is an \"affected group?\"   At what point does the inclusion of any group that claims \"affected\" status create such conflicts with archaeological and scientific pursuits that the term \"affected\" must be clarified?"
"Reasonable to a point, but knowledge should be in the ownership of the human race, not a particular ethnicity or group."

NA
"Does not specify Native American and it should"
NA
"Not only that, but help Indigenous groups build capacity and training opportunities. We also gave an obligation to learn about contemporary cultures and language to learning cultural perspectives."
NA
"It's well meaning, but in the world of CRM/project clearance, meaningful interaction with affected groups is primarily (ca. 95 of the time) just lip-service."
NA
"Local community members are giving their permission and participating in the research and results."
NA
NA
NA
"Its such a subjective statement that it is utterly devoid of meaning. Who is an affected group? In what way are they affected? Is the effect imagined or real? Is it costly? Does it divert funds from more important tasks to address effects that are either imagined or contrived for political purposes? Does subordination of scientific research to other wants undermine the credibility of the entire process?"

"Statement needs to be stronger.  Given many past abuses of lack of consultation, there needs to be stronger language here.  Give some examples of what is unacceptable.  Also, possibly, an enforcement mechanism needs to be developed."
"\"acknowledgment\" doesn't seem strong enough"
NA
NA
"I believe consultation with tribes needs to be expanded upon, and the current efforts need to be strengthened, and resources allocated for more options provided to meet contemporary tribal needs."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Affected groups are self-defined, often manufacturing relationships that never and don't exist."
"Particularly the descendants of the record(s) and incorporating their knowledge of the long-term effects of the behaviors indicated in the record(s)."
"\"Beneficial to all\" should be stressed more."
"Consultation is simply not adequate to describe current ethical demands on archaeological practice. We need to be encouraged to collaborate with and partner with affected groups, when appropriate accepting the leadership and authority of non-archaeological entitiies who have validated cultural claims to archaeological sites and collections.
"

"I think, however, that often interested parties are not consulted until after the fact."
"The principle should be revised to emphasize the special status of descendant communities, particularly Native American descendant communities."

NA
"The ethics standards seems to have been written solely for North America. Having been worked outside of North America for 20 years, I feel that I am a guest of that country,. Consequently, My first responsibility is to meet that country's archaeological standards unless there is something that is clearly an unethical expectation.  Fro example, the country I work in has historically been uninterested in involving local communities (although this is changing in parts of the country). Who am I as an outsider to tell them how to do their community involvement."

"there should also be accountability to colleagues and other professionals, in addition to the language above"
NA
NA
"RPA is the sole source of legal / binding accountability. We now know from experience that encouragement is not working. We now know (and have for decades) that Indigenous owners / stewards require specific consideration."
"There is a question of what constitutes an affected group. Not all groups who claim a relationship with archaeological materials do, in fact, have a legitimate relationship or legitimate claim.
I make specific note, again, of the contexts of my work, in the Near East. For the record, Jewish religious lobbies in Israel lay claim to ALL burials, including prehistoric burials (e.g., Neolithic). Notably, there is financial incentive for such claims since burial is state supported, so that the reburial of archaeologically recovered human remains is reimbursed (to the religious burial societies) by the state."
NA
NA
"This statement should include a stronger statement on indigenous rights as partners in stewardship of archaeological resources. We have an obligation to do more than just consult, this requires listening and commensurate action on our part. See recent issue of the SAA Record on the \"Archaeologies of Listening\" by Kehoe et al."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Consult does not mean bow to the whims of affected groups.  The science of archaeology must be advanced over opinion or the latest post-modern fad."
NA

NA
NA
NA
"This principle has multiple parts. It might be good to divide it into accountability to the general public with a more restricted one that is accountability to descendant communities."
NA
NA
NA
"I suggest adding \"to collaborate or consult actively\""
"I believe our first ethical obligation is to the material remains of the past. The very act of defining 'affected group(s)' may interject potentially damaging political considerations.  Consultation is fine, but in my opinion everyone is an affected group."
"Archaeology without consent from descendant communities IN ALL CASES is a form of violence. It needs to stop."
"I would add that we have a responsibility to use our specialized knowledge to support affected groups when appropriate. For example, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe in Massachusetts has been attacked recently by the Dept of the Interior. It is not enough to include the Mashpee as stakeholders in work within their Homeland-- we can also use our knowledge of their history and our position as \"authorities\" to support and protect their rights."
NA
"Use open access reporting whenever possible, and make your databases available for future researchers. Bring our research out from behind paywalls."
NA
NA
"Explicitly acknowledge the special position of indigenous communities and other descendant communities, above and beyond other \"affected groups\"."

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"To a point... but there are groups in the public who will not reform or curtail their activities that threaten the archaeological record, will not engage with archaeologists as equal partners, or do not wish to see archaeology practices performed in any way. It is Sisyphean to try to continue to egage with these audiences once identified."
"I think this could be amended to better reflect the roles archaeology can play in amplifying previously suppressed voices and interests."
NA
"This is probably about as good as we can get. If folks are honest about it, it will work in most cases. The crux of the problem is \"affected group\", although \"consult\" is also open to widely different interpretations. 

 I think about a situation in which a group wants to consult on my work, which is on material and people who lived over 10,000 years ago in the Southeast. If I interpret \"affected group\" to encompass some reasonable standard of cultural connection, I'd be justified in concluding no one living today is affected. If I interpret the term to include people who say they are affected, then that could include tribes, Barry Fell enthusiasts, archaeologists, and Biblical literalists."
NA
"Archeology, by itself, is already a subject of interest and geared to the public, as well as history and anthropology ... Its commitment to science and people is intrinsic."
NA
"Too many people and groups with no association with the prehistoric people under study have been given far too much power to influence budgets and research directions."
NA
"Additional specificity would help here in regards to descendant communities"
NA
NA
NA

NA
NA
"For sure. This addresses complex issues of accountability, equity, and who \"owns\" the past."
"I would like to see a much stronger recognition of the rights of stakeholders, particularly those from descendant communities, along the lines of the ethics statements supported by WAC"
"Need stronger wording here. Maybe this Principle should come first. What \"punishments\" or \"reprimands\" are there for archaeos who do not follow this principle? In my experiences, many (white male) archaeologists still believe in knowledge for knowledge's sake despite effects on local people."
NA
"I agree but the groups are varied from across a wide spectrum - political groups, land owners, natives, students, etc. It is not a simple situation of \"good\" groups versus bad."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"There is no public involvement on eligibility determinations.  This is a major step in the Section 106 process that is done behind closed doors, and can be quite capricious."
"My primary responsibility in many contexts is following the law. \"All parties involved\" is too broadly defines. I realize this is an aspirational goal, but the wording could be improved and should have included reference to the law."
NA
NA
NA
"As the age of prehistoric archaeological remains increases, it becomes concomitantly difficult to identify \"affected groups.\" Who is a member of the \"affected group\" when the investigated remains are 5000, 10,000, or 15,000 years old? Ultimately, this is a socio-political question, not a scientific one."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"This needs further development and ref to concepts such as FPIC"
NA
"A stronger commitment to community partners is needed."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"This is incredibly wishy-washy. Do better. We are obligated to consult with descendant populations whenever possible. If there is a conflict in terms of how resources are distributed, there will have to be \"winners\" and \"losers,\" as resources cannot be controlled by two groups at once. On the other hand, presenting alternative views based on alternative perspectives is always possible and should be done as transparently as possible. Archaeologists should also acknowledge that, by virtue of their position and funding, they almost always benefit from unequal power relationships between themselves and descendant populations and should work to minimize this inequity."
NA
"Too long a history of ignoring how we impact others"
NA
"The definition of affected groups can be very challenging to define."
NA
NA
"I agree with this principle, but it is very vague. I know it's hard to write something that is applicable in all situations, but terms like \"reasonable effort\" and \"in good faith\" kind of skirt around the issue of neocolonialism."
NA
"Mentioning work and consultation well in advance of research, mitigation, etc. would be a positive addition here."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I don't feel like public accountability and consultation with affected groups are the same thing at all.  This could be two different principles."
NA
"I am not sure what the phrase \"affected groups\" means here.  Depending on how it is defined, it could be all of humanity, and if so, active consultation is impossible."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"But it is hard to define precisely (not to mention legally) who are \"affected groups.\""
NA
"There needs to be *much* more elaboration on what an affected group entails---do we only need to consider only those we directly impact, how do we identify potential victims of secondary/indirect effects, and how do we incorporate their interests into our praxis?"
"I think that \"every reasonable effort\" should be more clearly defined. As written, some people could do minimal outreach and still consider that they are acting ethically."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Would benefit from a more detailed exposition of 'affected groups'.  Does this include fellow professionals engaged in similar research, in similar areas,or both?  If so, include.  Consider the tension between reasonable consultation and coordination with protection of intellectual and cultural 'property'."
NA
NA
"again, related/ descendant groups should be explicitly acknowledged in addition to, or as part of, the \"affected\"."
"be more specific on \"affected groups.\""
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Use of word \"consult\" with -- could be changed with collaborate.   Consultation emphasizes the top down relationship. To the extent possible, I would like the revised codes to emphasize the value of real partnerships, recognizing the power differential, but working to ameliorate that."
NA
"This does not go far enough. Simply making an effort to consult actively with descendent and affected groups is not enough, regardless of whether it is in good faith. If there are affected and/or descendent groups, archaeological investigation should not proceed without their express approval and, if desired, active participation."
"Relationship building is the foundation of organizational imperative. When investigative research may negatively affect a living populations oral history, beliefs, and lifeway, it behooves the researcher to actively afford and consult with those living populations BEFORE publication of material. The purpose of this statement is the researcher may not know of extenuating historical narratives passed from generation to generation within the population which is not part of the written observed historical record."
"The language used in this principle, esp. \"reasonable effort\", does not go far enough in shifting the balance of accountability onto archaeologists. I believe that modern archaeological research should be completely predicated on public accountability and collaboration."
"Exploitation (including plagiarism and softer forms of taking credit for others work) can be addressed here"
NA
"To me if there are indigenous stakeholders they get a higher degree of priority in terms of accountability than other stakeholders. I am also unsure what public accountability even means in this statement."
"Accountability and transparency and respect are tantamount, as always."
"Could be stronger, in relationship to consultation with descendent communities."
NA
NA
"Principle 2 offers some good ideas, but I find it practically unenforceable.  CRM firms cannot be held accountable when the client directs them to return artifacts to owners and holds the reports of investigations as propitiatory information, with the client often basing the action on the rules that federal agencies are applying.  

I have seen some evidence of an increase in efforts to more broadly consult with affected groups, but there is such a long ways to go before we can begin to think that we - the archaeological community - are living up to the aspirational focus of this principle.  I think that many American Tribes and indigenous populations still find that they are shut out of the process."
"Sometimes depending on the community setting and archeological sensitivities.  Permits might require such efforts."
NA
"Problem is that \"consult actively with affected group(s)\" is subjective, potentially paralyzing archaeological action."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Too narrow in focus"
NA
"Right - but this is not just a matter of submitting reports on time (a practice which some of my colleagues seem also not to do). Active consultation requires developing long-term relationships that sometimes do not produce permissions for years. We would let someone take a backhoe to our patios without a whole lot of discussion, and yet most archaeologists seem to feel like -- if they are on public land and have official permission-- it doesn't much matter what descendant communities think. Or they focus on one sector of descendant communities who will work with them, and do not invest effort in working with the dissenters.

I'm not surprised, now, that so many descendant communities lump archaeologists with developers, because too many use their privilege to do whatever they please.  I work in Southeast Asia, and AFTER I get my official permissions I consult with local stakeholders: even when the official permitters think this is extraneous.  Occasionally I am told that we aren't welcome; most of the time we can work where we request; and everyone feels better about it. But we excavate smaller areas, and invest more time in consultation, than almost any archaeologist I know. So the field needs to support and reward people for doing the right thing."
"This can also be stronger.  What is a working relationship? Cause a reasonable effort is often not good enough, and used as an excuse for exploitation."
"pretty vague"
NA

NA
NA
"It applies, but not adequately. I think \"consult actively\" is the bare minimum; archaeologists should do more. \"Affected groups\" does not capture the connection many people have to sites and objects\" Projects can't always and shouldn't always \"be beneficial to all parties involved\""
NA
"Yet one of biggest problems is the lack of public access to most of the work from CRM and other activities. SHPO & archaeologist withhold information out of concerns about looting should public learn where many sites are located. In Ireland, Tanzania & many other countires archaeological sites are shown on publically available maps. In these countris people take on the task of protecting their sites from vandalism and furthering access & visitation."
"There must also be an effort to recognize and involve indigenous communities in all research whenever possible."
NA
"I think Indigenous groups deserve special mention here."
NA
"I think this could be worded more strongly. It's not just about making every reasonable effort. Sometimes, if you cannot work with the groups, you should not do the research. I feel like this wording allows people to feel that they have made an effort, but it didn't work, but since they have done all they could, they should go ahead anyway."
"It is important that local communities be included in the process of investigation to the degree possible. At the very least, public dissemination of research results should be standard."
NA
NA
"It would be helpful to list at least exemplars of \"affected groups\" as some people may not think sufficiently outside the box about who are stakeholders."
NA
"Due to the particular racist and colonialist historical and cultural background of archaeology (especially in North America), this should really include an explicit reference to working with Indigenous groups."
NA
NA
"The greatest difficulty is the often conflicting groups, who do not want other groups to have an equal level of consultation."
"The statement echos regulations around cultural resource management a little too much for me, in that it isn't specific enough. It doesn't even include a mention of following regulations or laws in place to protect, for example, native american interests."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Archaeologists need to respect local and governmental concerns in whichever country they work. This can be a delicate balance, but ultimately archaeology benefits when it can coordinate with both top-down federal requirements and bottom-up desires from local communities. This can lead to a great deal of contention."
"\"Affected groups\" might be defined."

"Archaeologists in the aggregate, tend to avoid dealing with outside groups, whether it be tribes or communities which could be affected by projects of which archaeology is a part. This doesn't mean that there are not very good and conscience archaeologists who regularly reach out to all parties, but this is still not the mainstream way of doing research and business."
NA
"Although this should not be necessary, many archaeologists do not recognize that there is (or should be) an \"all\" before \"affected groups\" in this principle. Best practices require recognizing, attending to, and mediating among the needs of ALL affected groups, including but not limited to descendant communities, landowners, and legally compliant artifact collectors."
"Should be \"archaeological research\" without the \"responsible\" - activities without accountability is not representative of archaeology at all, not just responsible archaeology. I think \"acknowledgment\" is not useful, since a practitioner can acknowledge a need and still not follow through."
"Examples of \"affected groups\" should be explicit, not sub-text."

"This statement has the same problem that all of them do: in order to be broad and inclusive, they tend to be vague.  I do not have an simple solution to this dilemma. But, for example, there will be situations where no solution will be \"beneficial to all parties involved.\"  And, there may be significant disagreements about who constitutes a \"party\" for whom I should show concern.
In general, I accept this level of generality and vagueness in the interests of maintaining an aspirational statement, but it can be frustrating."
"\"Affected groups\" are politicizing scientific research in a determinedly unscientific way. They have succeeded in deliberately stopping and distorting conclusions and results to conform to leftist ideaology, rather reminiscent of Soviet Lamarckism of 1930's-1950's, a sickening trend abhorrent to scientists everywhere, which SSA has latterly called \"ethics\"."
NA
NA
"This is pretty weak as \"aspirational principles\" go. This says \"affected groups\" should be consulted and working relationships created, but not what the obligations of the researcher should be (or what should be aspired to) nor what the authority of partners to influence things like publication could be. I feel like this is an area where archaeology often falls short and this principle might be better if it directly addressed some of the common shortcomings (i.e., consultation that is cursory or after the fact, agreements that favor the researcher and provide no lasting authority to subject communities, etc.). What is the principle for? Maximizing benefit? Justice? Minimizing harm?"
NA
NA
NA
"I'd go stronger than 'consult' but the statement is mostly adequate."
NA

NA
"This builds on Principle 1 and makes the calculations in Principle 1 clearer"
"What does \"acknowledgment of public accountability\" mean?"
"Native American consultation is certainly appropriate.  However, the archaeological resources belong to ALL Americans, All citizens, not to a select minority."
NA
"Stronger statement about working with descendant communities. Maybe change consult to collaborate or use both \"consult and collaborate\"."
NA
"More specific language regarding examples of \"working relationship[s] that can be beneficial to all parties involved\" would be desirable, at least to highlight the kinds of questions that we should be asking ourselves as we approach this aspirational ideal: how does this relate to project planning? Analysis? Provisions for authorship? Control of intellectual property?

At the very least, the principle should state that ideally these working relationships should be formalized with Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs), so that at the very least there are paper trails to show the extent of good-faith effort on the part of archaeologists."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Can anything ever be beneficial to all parties?"
"This needs to be reworded to make it clear that this extends to our professional organizations. I suspect most - including the board and staff of SAA - read this principle as regard to consulting with descendant communities. The mishandling of the events and ensuing criticism of SAA in 2019 demonstrated this very clearly. We are also sometimes the affected group and our organizations need to be accountable for their actions or in actions as well."
"Acknowledgement is too weak
Archaeological research must include collaboration with descendants and communities in which sites are located and whose heritage is being investigated."
"Name the professional activities such as CRM
Commitment is not strong enough, reasonable effort too weak"
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"\"To make every reasonable effort\" is a CYA clause. If we are to improve our ethical standing, and our relationship with indigenous people, we HAVE to consult. Consultation is more than mere informing; it is giving affected groups opportunity to redesign projects so that they are mutually beneficial."
"Though more clarity in what those relationships are is important, including reciprocity in tribal issues"
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Not sure this is strong enough, given archaeology's past and current issues with indigenous peoples, particularly regarding consultation. Strengthening this principle could include specifying that \"consult actively\" is not a unidirectional info dump but rather a conversation led primarily by affected groups, and not archaeologists."
"\"affected group(s)\" is not clearly defined and it needs to be. Who are the affected communities? More emphasis needs to be placed on consultation with indigenous and marginalized groups."
NA
"The public doesn't always want to get involved. Facilitating pubic accountability should be part of this. How do you address that?"

"Not strong enough."
"It strongly applies, but is generally poorly followed."
NA
"Again, pretty vague. Maybe should specify indigenous groups."

That can mean a lot of things and allow many archaeologists to put in a token effort of working with indigenous people and when it doesn't work out, they can say they did their part.

"too vague"
"I'd love to see the word 'collaborate' in here with respect to community/affected group{s)"
NA
NA
"This principle suffers from a lack of clarity and seemingly instates a hierarchy between archaeologists and the public. 'Public accountability' seems to infer that archaeologists need to tell the communities that they are responsible when too often it is the archaeologist that needs to be reminded of their accountability to the community. Consulting with the affected groups is great, but there also needs to be a recognition that not all impacted groups should always have equal say--the opinions of construction companies should not be weighted equally with the people trying to protect their cultural heritage from destruction. A mutually beneficial working relationship is a great aspiration as well, but we must account for those moments when communities do not want research to continue (or to start) and those wishes should be honored. Just as the stewardship principle needs to recognize accountability to descendant communities, this principle needs to recognize that stewardship of cultural heritage as decided by the descendant communities should be of primary concern when considering accountability to impacted communities."

"I would add that this is just as applicable to principle 1, conservation."
"Something must be said about what happens when a local community does NOT agree with the proposed research.  In some Native American communities forma legal contracts are required but in others this is not mandatory.  Should the research be put on hold until there is agreement?  Many would argue that it absolutely should be."

These include, of course, Native communities (sometimes divided among different perspectives) but also sometimes real fringe groups (goddess communities, people who want to dig up sites on their own land but who are not qualified to do so).

"This is an important principle, but it has a gap.

Academics need to be taught that most archaeology is now paid for through taxpayer dollars (federal grants are also supported by tax dollars).  Therefore, archaeologists must be accountable to the public for the proper use of those dollars.  Consultation is critical whether formal or informal."

"What is meant by a higher claim in terms of application? Despite the above argument that archaeologists should place a priority on the archaeological record, there is a genuine recognition that other groups may have other priorities. In terms of working wiht other groups, it was agreed upon that this is a good thing but someone needs to be THE decision maker. However, there was a lot of disagreement over who THE decision maker should be. Many folks felt it should be an archaeologist, some folks felt it should be a descendant, and some of the older and wiser folks among us suggested a neutral arbitrator in which all stake holders brought their claims to the table, and then the arbitrator would make the final decision.  

In terms of public accountability -- again, no one disagrees with this idea, but how is it enforced? Who decides what is enough public accountability? What IS public accountability? If this principle was rewritten, more specific information along these lines seem warranted."

I think the statement should be changed from \"... consult actively ...\" to \"... consult, or facilitate consultation, actively ...\" Also, the goal is not always to establish a \"working relationship\" but to establish an outcome, or outcomes, that are beneficial to the group(s) whose heritage is represented by the resource."
"the statement is not strong enough and it needs to specifically identify descendant indigenous communities who can be disproportionately negatively effected by archaeological research. the term \"consult\" is too vague in this statement and it needs to emphasize more what the discourse between archaeologists and indigenous communities look like and what the desired result should be. Having worked with federal agencies for more than 35 years the term consult is meaningless to many indigenous communities, perhaps need to identify and employ a more descriptive and sincere term here."

An example that comes to mind is a situation in a country where I was doing research, where local indigenous groups were being told that they had no history or heritage in the area, which at the time was being despoiled and indigenous people displaced by an organization that had falsified its application for an access permit. But the wrong information that purported to say that the indigenous people had no historic connection or rights to be there and be involved in governance was being promoted by the government of the country.  We researchers were able to show the local indigenous group slides of the archaeology and ethnihistory of the area that documented the strong evidence that the local group had been there for thousands of years and that the majority population of the country had only been there a few hundred years at most.  The lack of basic education on the history and archaeology of the area limited people's recognition of their rights and that limited their role in the preservation of the landscape of of their culture and population."

As well, there may be affected groups for which consultation will not result in a positive outcome and may only further an already-negative situation."
"I think this is an important principle, although it could be stronger. The language of \"affected group(s)\" is also a bit vague. Is everyone equally important in these considerations, and should they be? For example, if we're talking about a space that is contested between a Native American nation and an oil company, should archaeologists be concerned with \"establishing a working relationship that can be beneficial to all parties involved?\" That's an extreme example, and maybe a bit black and white, but I hope it clarifies my meaning.

I have worked at some well-known (hence, profitable) archaeological sites and found myself embroiled in local politics several times. This is an interesting point, but a complex conundrum on the ground. I remember excavating monuments that later went to a local museum, only to have the central government send trucks to move the monuments to the capital, 900km away. I did not want to monuments to make the journey and saw the protests at the museum when locals demanded that their cultural patrimony remain local. The archaeologists in charge of the recoveries were never consulted, which led to more animosity. There were different cultural groups speaking different languages, local and federal officials making constant demands [grifts and grafts] etc. This reality was never covered in any book or class at any university I attended."

When it conflicts with other responsibilities, this primary obligation can supersede the goal of seeking new knowledge and can lead to decisions to not undertake or to discontinue a project.\"

"Again, there are times when information about sites or artifacts have a spiritual or ritual significance, and the needs and wishes of the parties whose culture and beliefs are reflected in those sites and artifacts should have priority over other parties desires. SO, the idea of \"beneficial to all parties involved\" needs to be clarified and carefully considered."

"This spirit of this principle is SO important. But, the wording could be improved. \"Consult actively with affects groups\" sounds like archaeologist are still in charge."
"\"Consult actively\" can be strengthened. I would like to see the SAA explicitly support collaboration."

"We should actively listen to and address the research questions of affected group(s) whenever possible while we conduct our work. This should be done prior to ever sticking a shovel in the ground. Our research design should always include the opinions and needs of community stakeholders."

"This principle is inadequate in modern archaeology. In its wording, it privileges the archaeologist and puts other stakeholders (e.g. indigenous communities) in second place. What if the archaeologist feels they have acted in good faith but a beneficial working relationship has not been established for all parties? Are they free to proceed in good ethical standing? The principle would seem to say yes. In my own practice we do not operate this way; we do not take what is not freely given. But I know that there are some archaeologists who act as if they are the arbiters of what is right in this regard and that have proceeded against the wishes of other stakeholders in their work."
"But I would like a clearer definition of reasonable effort. I feel so many folks get around consultation."
"\"Affected groups\" might not be specific enough and doesn't offer grounds for making a decision about which groups might have priority. \"Affected\" is pretty vague."
"Don't go too far if X, Y or Z tribal person says, \"No, this is sacred\".  The sites wouldn't exits if archaeologists hadn't fought for their preservation and study for over 100 years."

"This has become much more complex than the assumptions under which Principle 2: Accountability was written. Many of the voices, public, descendant community, property owner, government agency, project developer, are highly competing on this topic.Being beneficial to all affected groups is not always possible, and often reflects regulatory limits for deferring to archaeological or descendants' concerns over economic or similar concerns."

"Unfortunately there is very little way to distinguish efforts to engage the public in good faith from simple lip service."
"This is unfortunately only a standard held high in CRM community and frequently ignored by the Academic one.  It is still rare today for any in Academic world to proactively consult with descendant communities or conduct outreach with public unless required to under law.  This statement needs to be tweaked to further push for more involvement with descendant communities and local populations by those conducting Academic research or research for research sake outside of a regulatory trigger."
NA
"A working relationship where all parties involved benefit equally is idealistic and in reality, I think we should stress to fellow archaeologists that we should be patient, listen, and give more than we take."
"This statement is valid and reasonable, so long as the parties involved are both acting good faith. Sometimes, one or more parties, researchers and stakeholders, may not be for certain reasons. There are circumstances where the object, site or landscape under review may transcend normal consultation, overriding the concerns of one particular party or stakeholder."

"I feel this principle is weak and comes across as perfunctory. It's not just about consulting actively and establishing working relationships, but of prioritizing the needs and wishes of descendant communities and stakeholders. There is a general level of public accountability because the archaeological level is irreplaceable, but there is also specific accountability to stakeholders tied to the individual histories of sites, regions, and communities."

"Again, it's fine as a general principle but doesn't really say much. What is a reasonable effort, who are affected groups? Is a reasonable effort more than the bare minimum required by law? Also why is the goal to establish a working relationship rather than something stronger?"

"This needs to be a stronger statement about working with descendant communities from the beginning - the initial planning stage of a project.  Not at the end or a brief notification.

In addition, it is beyond frustrating to hear bioarchaeologists say, \"well, I don't work in the US, so NAGPRA doesn't apply, and I don't know much about it.\" NAGPRA (repatriation, tribal involvement)  touches on a major ethical accountability foci within the field of archaeology, and needs to be a standard part of training, whether academic, CRM or amateur."

NA
"Perhaps define \"affected\" and \"groups\" and/or provide an example
Perhaps replace \"affected\" with a different adjective"

NA
"Wording here can be more robust to go beyond \"consult actively with affected group(s).\" \"Affected groups\" is a vague term-- does this refer to descendant communities? the local community? the broader public? Stakeholders can be more clearly defined. Furthermore, consultation does not equal collaboration. Bare minimum legal consultation may not be ethically rigorous enough (e.g., what about Native American groups that are not federally recognized?)."

"Archaeologists need to finally distance ourselves from ideologies and rhetoric that divorces our stewardship of the material record from the real concerns, property, and livelihood of living descendent communities. We should be doing research ONLY if it is for, with, and by descendent communities which we have knowingly silenced and marginalized for far too long."

"Yes, but there needs to be a better and more open and transparent process for doing this. Often, consultation is simply sending letters and paying lip service. Establishing working relationships and trust is key, but also working to develop a new and more enlightened archaeology that can better serve the needs of multiple intellectually and spiritually divergent communities."
