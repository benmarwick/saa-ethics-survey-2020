This requires collaboration and consultation in advance of the excavation and analysis. SAA members must respect the wishes of the culturally affiliated descendant communities.

The ethical principles do not address appropriate and meaningful consequences for violations of these principles.
The ethical principles do not address how to address ethical violations form other fields. For instance, a person who violated ethical principles while completing anthropological fieldwork now wants to conduct an archaeological excavation. Does the SAA, state SHPO , state museum, or the Smithsonian look at their background to assess these situations?

The Ethics code is strongest on the archaeological record; for that I am grateful to Alison Wylie and Mark Lynott. But the code remains terribly weak on the people side (descendant communities, students, etc.).  Joe Watkins may remember me as appearing (to most of my fellow board members) as a strident leftist or something in pointing these issues out, but my points have emerged through a series of egregious experiences since then.  I was told repeatedly that "the SAA is a service organization, and has no legal teeth": but we really could have done a better job in outlining ethical expectations then.

How I wish that the SAA had not been so risk-aversive. We could have avoided the kind of blowback (particularly after last year's meeting) that drives younger members away. I can't tell you how frustrating it has been to try to remind my junior colleagues that the SAA is US, and that starting a new organization does not fundamentally change the system. So frustrating. Anyway, it's great that you folks are returning to these issues now.

Archaeologists have benefited financially and intellectually from the study of this record, often at the expense of these groups, either through the loss of resources or other economic losses, or their patrimony. There needs to be a principle that specifically recognizes the interests of Native Americans and other descendant groups and the responsibility of archaeologists to give back to the members of these groups through such means as employment, training, and capacity building to empower these people to become better and more knowledgeable stewards of their own heritage. Many archaeologists have done this training indigenous people as archaeological field technicians and analysts and building local museums to support heritage tourism to aid local economies and preserve local cultures. And while I am on the subject of heritage, this might be a good place to address what cultural heritage consists of. When we talk about the archaeological record, the emphasis is on tangible heritage--the houses, pottery, and tools created in the past. But we should not ignore the intangible heritage--the customs, language, dances, and festivals associated with those material objects. It is this intangible heritage that indigenous groups are usually most interested in preserving and archaeologists must recognize the need to assist them in this respect. </td> </tr>

Also, the issue of enforceability and what the code means practically is something I think should be closely reviewed by the committee. Should the code have a different format where breaking some code rules leads to loss of membership and others are more aspirational or best practices? There's a difference between taking 8 years to write a report and sexually assaulting someone. Is it SAA's intention to have RPA deal with all SAA ethical issues, or are we going to establish our own qualifications for retaining SAA membership? I hope the Code comes to have more teeth and I fear it is just currently a document with little real-world implications. But perhaps the way the Code is used is just not highly visible. </td> </tr>

I think there needs to be more attention to community-based archaeology and archaeology that works with descendent communities. In that vein, I think more attention needs to be given to the specifically colonial and postcolonial political contexts that archaeology is conducted within. Trying to frame ethics in more neutral terms that leaves these power relations unnamed only re-inscribes normatively colonial and settler vantage points. As it stands, the Principles of Ethics normalizes archaeologists as the natural proprietors of the archaeological record - a state of affairs solidified in the 1906 American Antiquities Act as it classified Indigenous remains as national heritage - in a way that obscures the more complex and contested politics of who owns the past.

Likewise, I think the segment on harassment - and discrimination - needs to be expanded. In particular, the ongoing structural racism, colonialism, sexism, and classism in academic universities, as well as micro-aggressions, should be discussed explicitly. In this sense, I would take the review of the Principles of Ethics as an opportunity to frame a system of ethics for creating a discipline and practice of archaeology that better serves marginalized and historically underrepresented communities. For example, archaeology is not an especially diverse field - and I think we have an ethical responsibility to look at the systematic mechanisms that reproduce that situation and change them. </td> </tr>
