"Principle 1: Stewardship"
NA
NA
NA
"Yes, but not to the detriment of living descendant communities."
NA
"I think we need to have a serious conversation as a society, as some are already doing, about whether archaeologists should be stewards of \"the record\" or stewards of relationships between stakeholder communities and institutions that claim privileged ownership of archaeological materials and data. As currently written, this principle risks losing sight of stakeholders and fetishizing materials. I was particularly reminded of the perils of this perspective a couple of years ago during a debate online about what to do about confederate monuments. One archaeologist, a Classicist, suggested that we had an ethical obligation to make sure that those monuments be preserved in a museum, even if they were taken down. Other anthropological archaeologists in the conversation suggested that we had an almost HIppocratic obligation to avoid doing harm -- and that the statues should be destroyed if they were doing harm. What was lacking in the conversation was a more applied discussion of alternatives to complete preservation and annihilation, involving digital documentation and curation."
"I believe that, in the U.S. and general North American case, this Principle leaves Native people and their stewardship preferences (Including not excavating) silent."
NA
NA
"I would only add that the principles of stewardship should be integral to our teaching and training of those who will carry on our work, and imparted to others who maintain an interest in archaeological discoveries."
NA

"Too many sites being excavated to simply \"get rid of them\" for the pleasure of developers since to compliance archaeologists, this is their bread and butter.

Too many sites being ignored to simply \"get rid of them\" for the pleasure of developers since to compliance archaeologists, this is their bread and butter.

Too many sites being excavated by field schools, or simply poked into by field schools with no publication and less than adequate and accessible documentation."
NA
"in addition to preserving the archaeological record for the general public we should also make an effort to focus on the wishes of the indigenous populations represented in the archaeological record. Descendant communities should be more involved in the preservation"
"It applies to archaeological aspiration but does not adequately define the parameters of practice. If a person does not read past #1 they will not encounter the more detailed content of other Principles."

"\"all archaeologists\" should be clarified to include avocationals and people in public outreach projects -- perhaps saying \"all who engage in archaeological work\" or even more explicit about avocationals and the public"
"If we are not direct descendants from the archaeological material, then we are in service to the descendant communities first and need to consult with them and collaborate on developing working protocols and values and action definitions under the term and role of stewardship."
NA
NA
"There should be a clearer connection here how archaeology can relate to other caretakers and also what to do if people do not feel that archaelogists should speak for them/take care of the past for them.
Finally, there should be a call that the past is not part of a profit deal."
"The problem is archaeologists are personally responsible of archaeological records, and have to respond to many other requirements, at the same time. From our Institutions. We sometimes cannot cover everything."
NA
"Stewardship is shared with other groups, including descendant communities. Archaeologists are not the sole advocates for the archaeological record."
NA
"it should apply but it does not. Most archaelogical field school excavations are so poorly funded that sampling is inadequate, the inadequate samples are inadequately studied, and the inadequate studies are never published. In truth, most archaeological faculty \"just dicking around.\""
NA
"Baring in mind that the various parts of the archaeological record have different value to different people. Just because something is \"unique/irreplaceable\" doesn't mean it automatically deserves stewardship."
NA
NA
NA
"The \"the benefit of all people\" needs to be reformulated to be more true. In practice, stewardship of the archaeological record seems to mainly benefit archaeologists and the patrons of archaeology. The benefits and rewards of stewardship need to be much more democratic"
"This principal gives archaeologists ownership of the past and does not consider our ethical obligation to include the considerations and principals of descendant groups."
NA
"I feel that this statement is too narrow:

\" It is the responsibility of all archaeologists to work for the long-term conservation and protection of the archaeological record by practicing and promoting stewardship of the archaeological record.\"

Also for this statement 

\"should use the specialized knowledge they gain to promote public understanding and support for its long-term preservation\"

I find that archaeologists tend to overwhelmingly talk down to members of the public as if members of the public do not often possess their own specialized knowledge. Something needs to be done about the paternalistic condescending approach that archaeologists often use when interacting with the public."
NA
NA
NA
"I believe we need to adapt to present societal needs (namely, more green infrastructure, affordable housing, promotion of healthy activities and ) which may include the destruction of sites. I also believe we need to adapt our records to incorporate more digital options, and thus will need a new database system for 3d models of sites."

"The use of the word 'conservation' is unclear. 'Preservation' is used below and these things are not the same. Conservation implies use and while of course we 'use' archeological sites, etc. in various ways (salvage information, education, etc.),  most everyone should agree (I'd argue) that strict preservation is the ultimate goal. I am a federal archeologist, you should know, which probably provides context for my opinion!"
"This feels really outdated - it is good as far as it goes, but it does not really address the more complex situations archaeologists are actually in: CRM archaeologists who authorize the destruction of sites following (or without) limited data recovery, curators who are forced to make painful decisions about deaccessioning collections; etc.

It seems weird that we are saying that the record needs to be preserved when our very reserach practices are themselves also destructive to field sites and to artifacts and samples. Needs more nuance to reflect real-world conditions."
NA

"True"
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"as in previous question, there is limited financial support for report writing and museum fees, limiting our ability to meet this important principle"
NA
NA
"I still support this principle as written, however I would strengthen it. Part of the preservation of archaeological sites is preserving the field records of any investigations at those sites (i.e., those field records need to exist in the first place). I would add in somewhere that archaeological work should not be undertaken if the information collected during that work is not recorded."
NA
"What about CRM firms lowballing one another to get contracts, then doing substandard work?  (Obviously that is not everyone, but it does happen.)  How is that practice in keeping with this ethical principle?  Might there be a way to revise to address this?  Maybe emphasizing that capitalist competition should not take priority over responsible practices?"
NA
NA
"As written, this is strongly focused on the control of knowledge and sites by archaeologists.  Stewardship should be a partnership with descendant communities and the public."

NA
NA

"I see the same issues with all the Principles: We need both democratization (elimination of the silly idea of archaeologists as the ultimate arbiters of the highest and best use of sites/belongings) and teeth (clarity that the Society expects ALL members to attend to professional ethics--probably best done, if I understand the legalities, via nudging all into RPA status)."
"I do not think that all specialists should be required to address the wider public, but I think that the wider public should have access to general archaeological knowledge."
NA
NA
"This statement should include an acknowledgement of indigenous land and rights to their heritage in the Americas. The statement \"for all people\" somehow seems to absolve archeologists of responsibility to indigenous people since we are more accountable to \"all people\" rather than directly to the people who's heritage we are trying to study."

NA
NA
"When possible, all sites should remain in situ. When required, excavation should only be completed by competent, trained archaeologists in cooperation with the communities the work affects. Artifacts and ecofacts should be treated in a way agreed upon by all stakeholders, and should remain with or be returned to the community in an orderly and timely manner. All human remains should be repatriated with due care and as quickly as can be accomplished appropriately."

"It's well-crafted, elaborating succinctly what it means to be a steward, for instance, and not just making lofty, aspirational statements. It adequately applies to practices and challenges today because it has ALWAYS applied to our discipline's practices and ethics."
"I think the focus on stewardship and public advocacy is more important than ever."
NA
"This is fundamentally problematic. It is a classic fox-in-the-hen-house conflict. Stewardship is simply a trust relationship, which requires the trustee (archaeologists) to act in the best interests of the master or beneficiary of the res (the archaeological record). The record doesn't want anything. We simply assume our masters/beneficiaries want what we want. For anyone who has asked around, this is simply not likely. 

it would be better to state what our goal is in the first Principle - truth, group advocacy, supporting people we affect - pick one. Truth using Western standards of evidence is the primary value implied in the Principle as written. Best to be clear whatever is chosen."

"As someone who researches the history of archaeology and as an editor who specializes (among other areas) in publishing old research, I know that quite frequently excavations and surveys occur, but are never adequately published, or even published at all. Furthermore, excavated or collected materials as well as records often disappear. While there are many reasons for this, and many obstacles to publication and preservation, when research is not published and/or finds and records disappear, professional archaeological interventions become no better than pot hunting."
"It would be nice to call out the importance of public outreach and its ties to stewardship in this statement."
"Generally I agree, but the voice, opinion, and needs of descendant/indigenous/local populations should matter equally. That is, I believe the primary responsibility of archaeologists should be to people alive today and what THEY ALSO want for objects of the past, rather than the automatic saving of things."
NA
"I agree but recognize conflicts with both power centers and with people with little power. In my own career it was very helpful that organizations (e.g. the Archaeological Society of Connecticut) were open and supportive of everyone. I want to the 25th anniversary meeting of the SAA in 1960 when I was a high school student in New Haven - possibly the only high school student at the meeting - and was treated very well."

"This is a core principle."
NA
"How could anyone \"agree\" or \"disagree\" with a statement of fact ('the archaeological record is irreplaceable\")?  How does one simultaneously \"investigate and interpret\" the record and \"support its long-term preservation?\"  The only way to insure the latter is to commit to NEVER digging an archaeological site and opposing EVERY landscape modification that might alter the record?  In which case there would seem to be little need for archaeologists except to analyze curated collections.  We better get to work before they are all reclaimed, \"repatriated\" and reburied!"
NA

"in some cases I don't think that a \"benefit for all people\" is possible, for instance when stakeholder needs or desires clash with those of the broader public"

"The \"archaeological record\" is itself a problematic concept, as it is essentially a metaphor derived from natural resource management fields. The term \"record\" implies some acknowledgement of the anthropogenic nature of archaeological remains, but fails to encompass the true nature of the resource, as it fails to recognize the culturally constructed nature of value underlying the resource. 

The idea of an archaeology is embedded in governmental and regulatory frameworks. Is the SAA an extension of those bodies, or are we something else?"
NA
"May be most important in the US right now"
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I agree with this principle, but it should be acknowledged how complicated this issue can be. Sometimes people loot for building material and wouldn't have a house for their family without doing so, or sometimes the only viable agricultural land in an area is right in the middle of an archaeological site. I'm not advocating for looting or the destruction of archaeological material, I'm just pointing out that community stakeholders should have a voice in deciding how the past is used. I know the counter argument is through public outreach and education archaeologists can demonstrate the importance of preservation, and I agree with that, but ultimately I am not going to tell a descendent community how they should view their own past."
NA
"Stewardship should be rethought as a first principle. There is a significant literature on this. 

Archaeologists have responsibilities, yes, but are not the appropriate stewards in many situations, nor should they be. \"All people\" is a moral and philosophical stance with respect to cultural heritage and material culture. In some situations, the appropriate response for a community is to allow degradation (through use or otherwise). Also, sometimes, things should not be seen or accessed by all people.

Also, engaging the reality of the political economy of archaeology in this statement would assist archaeologists to see how the structures in which our professional lives are enmeshed, formed, and limited/enabled, has a huge, huge effect on how we interpret what should or can be preserved. In other words, most archaeologists are failing massively in terms of any kind of complete or capable or competent protection of the archaeological record, depending on how stewardship, protection, and preservation are defined (whether compliance, CRM, academic in origin). 

This aspirational principle, in its current form, is almost not helpful because of the discontinuity with what most of us are trained and paid to do most often (destroy and make limited record of contexts; with limited curation; with severely limited resource base for preservation, conservation, interpretation, access, and interoperability).  If we really took seriously this call,  stewardship would refocus every single person on existing collections and on mitigating through publication collections that result from the ongoing destruction that society deems unavoidable due to needs for nicer houses or less traffic or more electricity, etc."
"I think it would be stronger if it specifically mentioned preserving sites in place as a top priority, and doing a good job of caring for data (records and artifacts) when sites are excavated."
NA
NA
NA
"I generally agree with this principle, but feel that it needs to recognize the importance of individual archaeological sites to different stakeholders, particularly descendant groups. While appreciate the sentiment that the past belongs to \"all people,\" this kind of language usually leads to stewardship on BEHALF of descendant communities, rather than in partnership with them."

NA
NA
NA
"The term \"in situ archaeological material and sites\" too much leans toward an Indiana Jones treasure hunting glamorized archaeology.  It is an all or nothing approach that results in a belief that it is OK for us to destroy 99% of the sites that are identified (less than 1% of all identified sites in the US are listed in or recognized as eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places) and that the only reason to conduct archaeological investigations is to collect those items that museum collection value - and thus reducing archaeology to an obsessive fascination with pretty artifacts that are easily held in one's hand."

NA
"Right - but a lot of archaeologists will not invest time in actually *doing* the work because it doesn't net them professional credit.  In the US, anyway, we seem to leave most stewardship to federal agencies and a few token \"public archaeologists\" rather than embedding stewardship into our projects (and asking for funding for stewardship in our grant proposals)"

"I agree that archaeologists are often in positions of stewardship and I agree with the need to conserve and protect archaeological resources. However, I do not think that archaeologists can ethically claim to conserve and protect the archaeological record 'for all people' when all too often our 'stewardship' benefits primarily ourselves and the non-Indigenous public, at the expense of Indigenous peoples whose ancestors created the archaeological 'resources' we are curating. Overall I find this statement very colonial in nature, and in grave need of revision."

"I believe that archaeologists should not place long term conservation over research in every case. There are places that will deteriorate naturally over the long term and should not be 100% preserved \"for the future\" if a case can be made for quality research in the present. The Archaeological Conservancy, for example, has occasionally placed long term preservation over excavation, blocking access to sites they control despite a proposal for reasonable and appropriate research."

"I'm largely neutral about this statement, but I do have a couple of issues. It dances around a number of important ethical issues, primarily in the statement that  archaeologists \"are both the caretakers of and advocates of the archaeological record for all people...\" We are one group of stakeholders among many, not the sole caretakers and advocates. I think the general principle of this Principle (preservation and advocacy) is fine, but it's in need of some reworking."

NA
"However, there is much digging, especially in Mesoamerica, for digging's sake, especially a focus on rich burials."
"Many archaeologists like myself work within other organizations for whom stewardship of cultural resources is not their number 1 priority.

NA
NA
"My only misgiving is that preservation can't be treated as *always* more important than the wellbeing of living people. When evaluating whether to protect the archaeological record or protect the living (if those things are in conflict), it's important to ask \"who will be helped and who will be harmed\"? Once that's answered, ask who wields the least social, economic, and political power and meet their needs first."

"I am not always in favor of conserving and protecting in situ archaeological material and sites at the expense of activities that take place today.

We fight to save sites while the 50yr old plus records of the excavation of those sites molder - or we carry out new excavations w/o adequate funding to do analysis and curate - weve placed the emphasis on bad actors as those outside of the fiend w/o recognition that we destroy sites as well."

For example, when it comes to Native American remains, for many cultures, those are supposed to decompose and return to the earth. Is this statement contradictory to their wishes for the remains of their people?"

"\"benefit all people\" puts some people at equal standing even though not \"all\" people are equal stakeholders. also, this implicit message in this principle is don't dig if you don't have to or don't dig poorly. I have been on field schools that, since they are teaching platforms, do poor jobs at excavation. Where units with experienced people somehow find significantly more of certain material culture than people in the other units. Those sites are forever destroyed now and we have bad numbers from them."
"It might be helpful to include the protection of community knowledge."
NA
NA
"This principle places the role of stewardship solely in the hands of archaeologists without recognition of the descendent communities which usually have very different views from archaeologists of what stewardship looks like. I have seen archaeologists manipulate this principle, claiming they alone know what is best for the material record and therefore are better protectors of artifacts sites than the cultures to which it belongs. Even though the accountability principle recognizes the need to work with impacted communities (which means a whole host of things), there needs to be some recognition in this principle that stewardship also means working alongside specifically the community to which the site or material belongs to decide what is best."

"In practice, however, I have seen minimal results in terms of protection of archaeological materials and sites by archaeologists working in my region of research (Mesoamerica/Maya region). All too often, foreign archaeologists undertake their field seasons in Latin America, often minimally analyze the materials, then turn the over to the governments of the country of origin with only basic records and storage materials. Often my colleagues say it's the country of origin's responsibility to take care of what the archaeologists have excavated. Yet we know this is financially and sometimes politically impossible, yet they continue to bring students into the field and excavate sites all in the name of academic research (not cultural preservation and education)."

"Why are archaeologists the de facto stewards of Indigenous pasts?"
NA
NA
"This principal is fundamental to what a professional archaeologist should always do."
NA
NA
NA
"Stewardship must include the acceptance of NAGRPA transfers to Native American communities, and on-going efforts to coordinate stewardship efforts with applicable communities.

At some point it will become absolutely critical to acknowledge the rights of other indigenous groups in the world in accord with the 1970 ICOM convention and more recent UN statements on indigenous human rights.  These considerations should be considered now before it becomes yet another crisis.  The cultural restitution movement in Europe is gathering steam now."
NA
"I do think it is our role to promote stewardship, but in support of descendant community interests. I also think it is important that we are not really the stewards, but have a \"seat at the table\" with those who are the stewards of their history. As archaeology becomes a more diverse discipline, the lines may become blurred, but as a discipline, I think we need to recognize we are not the only authority on the pasts that we study."
"Long term preservation is always a problem, to do it correctly it is expensive.  Funding is always a problem at all levels, state, federal, and private."
"I do have some questions about how this applies to archaeologists working in cultural resource management, who often are forced to decide what can and cannot be preserved, and who are frequently forced into situations where limited time or money force uncomfortable decisions. Is working on a project where some important archaeology is destroyed to enable the saving of other parts of the archaeological record unethical? In my experience, it has sometimes felt that way.

"My only hesitations are that 1) \"avoidance\" (in situ preservation by deferring action) is not always preservation, and that natural processes should be considered in the inherent loss of information through time; 2) We are increasingly confronted with the issue that \"for the benefit of all people\" is not a cultural universal, and that some descendant communities have a vested interest in histories that cannot be confirmed (and in some cases are denied) by archaeological investigations; and 3) there is a difficult-to-negotiate line by pandering to voyeurism in building public support for stewardship and considering the interests of descendant communities (often we, as archaeologists, are less sensitive to the derivation of our own values from a Euroamerican cultural value system)."

Archaeologists need to consider archaeological sites and archaeological collections, including all the digital associated records they produce, as equally important resources.

In general, it was agreed upon that archaeologists primary responsibility is to the archaeological record. If this means that we excavate a threatened site to collect data against the wishes of descendants, then so be it. If this means that we preserve a site for the future and dont let archaeologists dig it today, then so be it.

"The principle places great emphasis on objects but people, other than the archaeologist, enter in as an almost afterthought in the form of an amorphous totality (\"all people\"). Although protecting the archaeological record for \"all people\" sounds like a nice idea, in practice this type of statement leads into a myriad of ethical quandaries. For example, ideas of national patrimony and world heritage are used to marginalize indigenous people in Mesoamerica and other parts of the world by providing a justification to remove people from their land. Several decades of research have demonstrated that object focused archaeologists will likely not have a bright future because indigenous and descendant communities all over the world are increasingly demanding stewardship over their heritage. Thus, I think we need a first principle that emphasizes a shared responsibility over the archaeological record and some mention of archaeologist conduct in relation to living people.

Principle 1 has a lot of merits but it makes no mention of our responsibilities to collaborate with descendant groups or to avoid harming living people.

However, a significant amount of research takes place outside the US, and even that research within the country takes place in lands belonging to or associated with indigenous people. Stewardship as caregivers implies a sense of property as if we are THE people with authority to speak of how other people should engage with archaeological sites. The word has no recognition about our role as subject to other countries' laws and the decisions of indigenous communities. We SHOULD be advocates, and we should hold ourselves to a high standard.

Doing so is not made any easier by poor curation practices. Additionally, this principle does not recognize that archaeologists are not the only stewards of archaeological materials. Descendent communities, who have a greater claim as stakeholders of cultural resources usually have different views from archaeologists of what stewardship looks like, and their wishes should be prioritized more than others. More often than not, the \"benefit of all people\" hides a colonial mentality, which extracts material resources from their place of origin for the benefit of a very small public, one, if we're being honest, really just benefits the archeologists involved.  Archaeologists can easily manipulate this principle, claiming they alone know what is best for the material record and therefore are better protectors of artifacts sites than the cultures to which they belong. Even though the accountability principle recognizes that archaeological practices should recognize the wishes of the communities most impacted by their work. The ethics committee can look to the ethical principles of community-based participatory research for direction here."

As a result, I, personally, am storing important research collections in my basement, a place that is not adequate in terms of conservation either of documents (labels) or objects.  Even some of the countries I've done research in have refused to curate collections sometimes, and when they have received them the treatment they accorded the collections led to their damager or destruction.

Indigenous peoples may think of themselves as \"caretakers,\" which is far more robust than \"stewards\" - my point isn't that archaeologists should be caretakers, too, but that as professionals we need to think of the complex social dynamics and interests at play. 

Likewise, is preserving heritage essential in every cultural context, or does it reflect a specific cultural framework with specific metaphysical anxieties about oblivion? Should statues of confederate generals be preserved, and what kinds of social spaces get opened up as these \"heritage\" objects and monuments to white supremacy are taken down?

Historically in the US, \"stewardship\" has meant the appropriation of ancestral Native American bodies and material culture in colonial institutions, so I think this principle needs to be reevaluated and rewritten."

"This is aspirational, for sure. In reality American Archaeologist working in academia are encouraged to take young and inexperienced students to exotic locales for fieldwork. Any 'data' recovered is horded by the directors and used to advanced that institutions viewpoint, like voting for your favorite theory through manipulation of the publishing system (see Bintliff, 2011). I wish American archaeologists were more up front concerning the embedded status of academia within the Capitalist socio-economic system. Even worse, the shady situational ethics of Survivor Island have infected academia like cancer. Every month a new scandal rocks the social sciences [Niall Ferguson's fall from Harvard's graces over petty departmental social warfare, fabricated spider data, published papers 'recalled' 'voluntarily' by suddenly ethical researchers and so on]."

"Stewardships is still vitally important, but it seems like this could be  more specific-- for example, mentioning climate change. Since I study coastal archaeology sites, I am keenly aware of the threats to these sites. 

Also seems a bit vague in talking about the \"public\" but not mentioning indigenous people specifically. This might be okay, but I don't think it should be first. I would prioritize indigenous rights before stewardship (in terms of the order of the principles)."

"As many have suggested, this principle puts the archaeological record, and by default archaeologists, as its stewards, in position of primacy. Now more than ever we need to realize that we are but one of many stakeholders that are just as invested in the practice of dealing with the material remains of the past. Thus, rather than simply acknowledging that the archaeological record needs protection, this principle should reflect the multivocality of interest groups that are involved in the practice of archaeology"
NA
NA
NA
"Although I understand and generally agree with this principle, it universalizes heritage such that it appears of equal value to all peoples, which is a very western, scientific perspective. The difficulty is that descendant communities have stronger ties to their archaeological record than everyone else and should have more say in its disposition, and this overlooks this issue. I am not sure how it could be easily resolved within the confines of this principle."

"I feel this is a long standing principal that the majority of archaeologists adhere to today.  There are a few select firms or individuals who for work will underbid the effort they really need to adhere to this or are willing to check a clearance box and when doing that erode these principals.  They are a very small minority of firms.  In addition, there are too many who do research for research sake and destroy resources that could otherwise be preserved. Archaeological excavation should be focused on endangered resources, either at natural (erosion) or development loss risk. So this statement is still relevant and should be always forefront."
"might be good to include reference to oral traditions, ethnographic, oral histories that pertain to specific archaeological records as also warranting stewardship by professional archaeologists"
"I think stewardship should also include publishing data and making our findings accessible to the public as well as presenting to the public"

"Ethical stewardship must necessarily involve descendant communities and other stakeholders. They are the rightful caretakers and advocates of the past. Archaeologists may facilitate and contribute to this process, but by no means do we have the monopoly on protection and interpretation of archaeological resources.

NA
"Strongly agree stewardship is important, but also needs to consider value of living people over their records, that archaeology is not done to the detriment of the cultures we study, and done in the spirit of collaboration and partnership.  Also needs to recognize stewardship done in partnership with citizens or descendent communities, include them in the definition of who is doing archaeology and who is broadly responsible for stewardship."

It doesn't help with questions like how much of a site to dig, how an archaeologist can balance their duty to the archaeological record with their work on a pipeline or highway, whether we should avoid excavation in some cases, whether it's ethical to start digging without having a long-term curation plan, whether research can be ethical when it involves dealing with landowners who are doing unethical excavations or with museums that are skirting NAGPRA."

"While the ideals of stewardship listed here are important, they also reinforce the idea that archaeologists know best/ know more than local descendant communities, particularly Native Americans.  

\"Stewards are both caretakers of and advocates for the archaeological record for the benefit of all people;\" - not all sites should be excavated or shared with all people.  The overarching \"cultural heritage for all' argument discredits Native American knowledge and expertise. Burial sites should not be disturbed. Ancestral remains and funerary, sacred and patrimonial objects should be returned to the appropriate descendant community(ies).  

Archaeologists need to set up partnerships with descendant tribes - real partnerships, not just lip-service.  Archaeologists are not the only stewards of the past, and they need to acknowledge and lift up voices other than their own."

"I think there is a serious issue with believing that the best option will always be in situ preservation when vast amounts of heritage are being destroyed by development, climate change, neglect, and conflict. There needs to be a balance in whether and what to excavate, what to actively preserve, and what to avoid that is recognized and attended to in a judicious, scholarly, and ethical manner that considers to long-term needs of multiple stakeholder groups as well as our shared understanding and experience of the human condition. European scholars recognize that just avoiding archaeology and leaving it in place can result in deterioration and loss of archaeological knowledge at a vast scale and is not demonstrated to be inherently good. Materials of cultural and archaeological significance do not constitute an archaeological record if they are not actually recorded."
