"Principle 8: Training and Resources"
NA
NA
NA
"Apologies to the Committee for my redundancy - all of the compound principles need to separated. Adequate - which really should be appropriate something stronger than adequate frankly - training, etc. is not the same as necessary resources for the short-term and long-term care for materials, records, and relationships. These are different things. As archaeologists, we work in minutia. These need to expanded."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Archaeologists should seek continuing education in new methods and research strategies, and provide opportunities for continuing education in methods we may develop or master. As we may become more specialized in our research methods, we are likewise responsible for developing research collaborations with others whose expertise complements our own, and should cross-train with them to the extent necessary for strong working relationships and joint publications."
NA
NA
"And yet, compliance archaeology is conducted on the basis of LOW BID - so how is that supposed to promote this ethical standard. As long as archaeology is procured and sourced as one would toilet paper you are going to have issues."
NA
"We should consider having mechanisms in place to punish and/or discourage for practices and have a peer review of practices as well as literature. In addition to this we should make it clear that poor behavior on part of our peers is unacceptable"
"There is no definition of \"adequate\" for anything to separate this from inadequate practice."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"But it should also be the responsibility of regulatory bodies assess the qualifications and standards of practice used. There needs to be more capacity at the regulatory level and there needs to be effective and legally binding consequences for destruction of archaeological resources due to neglect."
NA
"Again - these are the best practices/guiding principles.  The target they embody cannot be realized on every project.  For example, I think that if there is a particularly strong public outreach component, that gain/exposure/learning opportunity outweighs the application of most rigorous, time consuming field methods."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"They should but they do not. I regard less than 1% of archaeologists as sufficiently trained to analyze materials and less than half as sufficiently trained to adequately manage excavations."
NA
NA
NA
"I think it is time the SAA considers licensing with minimum standards for professional practice.  We can start with NPS Qualifications."
NA
"Training must be:

(1)  more democratic;
(2) provided in contexts with more just and equitable labor practices (not by exploited / disposable \"adjunct\" or other people struggling with precarious conditions)."
"Too excavation focused."
"more and better training is necessary"
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Archaeology has been an insular endeavour, and we should promote more cross-discipline communication and training. We need to become easier to work with, which will come from a greater understanding and respect of the way other industries discuss and manage data."
"I agree but most in CRM are spitting into the wind on this one. It doesn't matter what they 'want\" to do, it matters that their agency can move forward with their projects. So that often overrides any want to do proper research."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"If one can't analyze what they uncover, and/or recruit those who can in a collaborative effort, then resources should not be disturbed."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"But if you don't have adequate training and experience, then you're not an archaeologist.    So it's worded a bit strangely."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"this is important, but it is hard to keep up. it is difficult to secure funding for many forms of analysis."
NA
NA
"While I agree with the sentiment, I think there is a very loose definition here of \"adequate training\". I have seen individuals who believed themselves be \"adequately trained\" to conduct fieldwork and make a mess of things. The ignorant don't know what they don't know. Perhaps referring to the Secretary of the Interior's standards for archaeology? There may not be much else we can say."
NA
NA
NA
"practically speaking this is often not possible in contract archaeological settings, esp. in remote places such as where I work, Oceania"
"I would add \"oversight\" after 'facilities.'"
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"There is a problem with proper training of archaeologists in field methods, particularly when working in countries where there are strict federal regulations and standards as to how excavate. Many students are ill prepared and often contribute to the destruction of archaeological data while learning."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Access to funding and analytical technologies is not evenly distributed or available across the field of working professionals. The policies of the institutions in which many archaeologists work are subject to change and can have an adverse impact on archaeological practice."
NA
"This seems very toothless.  Shouldn't there be a reference here to what these qualifications are?  Such as, state standards, Secretary of the Interior Standards and Directives, RPA..."
NA
NA
NA
"Again, RPA research standards contain most of the required details."
NA
NA
NA
"I feel that this element is somewhat meaningless in practice. We don't seem to follow this as a general profession. This element could include a statement to learn from and adhere to guidance provided by indigenous or descendant communities as part of that training and expertise."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Could be a bit more specific. All excavations should be accompanied with a curation agreement. There are still archaeologists working on private land who have artifacts in their garage and no plans for preservation of collections or records."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Training is important, but I order to learn how to properly destroy an archaeological site in the name of knowledge nor preservation, the only real way to do it is by destroying an archaeological site, but with students instead of professionals."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Extremely aspirational. How are newer archaeologists going to learn? In some ways this can be read as indoctrination into a purely professional club that sends the same old message of - it's okay for us to do it, but not okay for you. 
Instead of using the word \"must\" in the first sentence, perhaps \"should\" or \"should attempt to\"."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Lowballing, hiring techs at the lowest hourly rates possible, hurrying through work and/or using inappropriate survey intervals, etc., are destructive actions that harm both the archaeological record and the overall reputation and public impression of the profession. This principle could be beefed-up considerably to make clearer this link between shady business practices and unethical behavior."
"This should be strengthened to include statements of equity and access to such training."
"This is self-evident.  It is like saying a dentist should know how to drill a tooth and be ready for an infection. I suppose that it does not hurt to restate it."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Over the years, I've run cross many archaeologists who supposedly have the proper training yet they are completely unqualified to instruct anyone. The field of archaeology needs new blood to flush out the entrenched bureaucracies that have formed to protect the status quo."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Sure, but who decides what is \"adequate training, experience, facilities, and other support\"? Some professional board like RPA? Governments? Universities? The archaeologists themselves?"
NA
"Difficult to implement without more specificity in regard to \"adequate.\" This also differs based on country, and level of training available."
NA
"For example, too many people think they can do Historical Archaeology (i.e. the archaeology of the Modern World Ad 1400 to the present) no matter what their own background, training, or interests are. Although I started in NA prehistory and Maya archaeology I would not excavated such sites but some colleagues think historic sites are just a side issue opened to anyone no matter what background or interests they have."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"However, sometimes you don't know what you don't know."
"Agreed, recognizing the variety of contexts archaeologists working in the US face."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Not sure that \"training, experience, facilities, and other support \" captures what is needed, nor that \"conduct any program of research\" clearly says follow the law and follow all applicable professional standards and other guidance of provide argued justification for deviation from standards"
NA
"Needs to be more completely and clearly stated."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Duh"
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"A statement that encourages other types of research (non-destructive) would be welcome here"
"The weakness of this one is that many archaeologists don't know what kind of team they need to follow it. Conservators get left out because people don't think about it. Same for artifact specialists, remote sensing, geologists, etc. You don't know what you don't know."
"With a move towards professionalizing archaeology, this may be expanded to include continuing education requirements or licensure."
NA
NA
"This should be stronger and more explicit. If the reference is to excavation, then it should include specific mention of those resources necessary to meeting ethics standards (e.g., funds, time, permissions, etc), rather than relying on \"consistent with the foregoing principles and contemporary standards of professional practice\".

Also, the reference here is individual/personal--as an archaeologist, I should have the necessary training, etc. to do the research I undertake. I also think it should address participation in the research OF OTHERS; more specifically, that archaeologists should only participate in research projects that also meet these standards."
NA
"Maybe we should work on enumerating the training, experience, etc.
One thing that could come out here is that you can hire someone who is going to do the absolute minimum or you can hire someone who is doing a good job.  This seems like a place where we could set some minimums."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"The federal standards for \"professional archaeologists\" are a joke and most graduate programs do little to train archaeologists to undertake field excavations - way too little attention to the nuts and bolts of their responsibility to the archaeological resources."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I believe that stronger langauge is necessary to improve Principle 8. The SAA needs to more explicitly acknowledge what \"adequate training\" and \"contemporary standards\" mean. There should be some attempt to assess what training in the field should look like and how students should be prepared for professional practice.

The SAA should also consider including establishing some kind of aspiraional standard for communicating what the field is and what its practice should like under this Principle. Developing Principle 8 to be as robust as Principle 9 might be a start."
NA
NA
"See my earlier comments."
NA
NA
NA
"have AND provide when possible--we have an obligation to train and not just be trained."
"We should expand what is meant by adequate."
NA
NA
NA

NA
NA
NA
NA
"The technological capabilities available in the present day (GPR, LiDAR, Thermoluminescence, etc.) can and should be further utilized in situ if possible. The removal of artifacts from in situ is the destructive portion of current investigative procedures, using on-site techniques may enhance the professionals' capacity to interpret in actuality extenuating additional information that is destroyed during extraction."
"The responsibility of senior archaeologists to train and mentor juniors should be included. Also a commitment to sharing of facilities and resources across institutional and national boundaries."
NA
NA
NA
"It would be nice to also see language that reflects a need to understand ontological differences in our application of theory and interpretive process."
NA
NA
NA
"I see a lot of good emphasis on training in academic programs and within CRM firms.  I would like to see more of this from federal and state agencies.  I would like to see the SAA get more involved in working to build connections to integrate the training across many different real world boundaries."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Archaeology today should be focused more on preservation and less on excavation. There are enough endangered sites (from development and climate change) that no archaeologist should ever excavated any sites that are protected without a strong reason to do so."
NA
NA
NA
"It's the wild west in our profession.  Until I intervened, our department actually sponsored an \"archaeological field school\" run by a biologist on Kauai (with nominal oversight by an archaeologist in my department who got salary but didn't go there) for students that offered them double the credits (12 credits) for five weeks of experience.  It took me several months, many phone calls and emails, and consultation with various agencies to figure out how this had happened in my own department (it was my job, as Archaeology convenor, to decide which field schools to offer). Wow.

To keep this in perspective, I once brought a UH grad student into the field in Cambodia with me who had completed a U Arizona field school and didn't know how to use a transit. U Arizona is MY alma mater! I was fortunate that one of my Cambodian students knew how to map and could train the American student. But still.

 I would love to see RPA or SAA certification required for all credit-bearing field schools."

NA
"My personal experience of 40 years in the field
Show me otherwise."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Perhaps add a responsibility of understanding that proposed analysis on many artifacts will cause their permanent destruction and therefore conducted wisely and with care."
NA
NA
NA
"How do people know what contemporary standards are?"
"It is incumbent on anyone contemplating a field investigation that they have the requisite training and tools to undertake the work properly. Maintaining a network of colleagues is also important in making it possible to bring in the expertise that one may lack."
NA
"Issues arise when archaeological resources are threatened so that they must be recovered immediately or lost forever.  Current funding mechanisms either aren't fast enough or don't allow for large enough grants (or both) to meet this standard, especially for more remote sites.  Funding for follow-on work after salvage needs to be more available."
NA
NA
"This is far too important an issue to cover in 44 words. What counts as training?"
NA
NA
NA
"As mentioned in a previous principle, perhaps the addition of a statement regarding when it is appropriate to excavate as once excavation is undertaken, the site (or that portion of the site) is gone for good."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I do not have feel we are adequately preparing the students of today with the resources to advance the study of archaeology nor even do it to the level it was practiced before -- very few technicians and way too many theoreticians."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"The phrase \"contemporary standards of professional practice\" is not clear in its detail."
NA
"In general, I believe that the archaeological community is doing a reasonable job with this. It can always be better, but overall is ok."
NA
"Because this is a rampant problem, it would be useful to explicitly state the training should encompass both the archaeological realm but also that of human interaction. If archaeologists are pursuing best practices, they are engaging local communities, and doing that requires a skill set many archaeologists lack."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"This is a critical one and is well stated.  You shouldn't do anything you aren't qualified to do."
"Does not address training future generations, nor does it really address resources"
NA
"What about creating some kind of annual or every-five year update of best practices sponsored and posted on the SAA webpage? Today best practice includes analyses that were unimaginable 15 years ago (phytolith analysis, starch grains, pollen, multiple C14 dates). Once launched in their careers, is there a way to make people about to launch a new field project aware of how extensive their analyses should be? This might help diminish the number of collections of material left unanalyzed because no one affiliated with the project had the analytical skills needed."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Training and resources should not just be ensured given the \"destructive nature\" of archaeology. Training and resources should not only be about technical training and physical resources, but should include workplace training, sexual harassment, etc."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"However, it is not entirely rare that one encounters situations in which students were sent into the field poorly supervised and without adequate resources and experience."
"Again, working in an institution that is not primarily meant for cultural resource management--we sometimes just have to do the best we can in terms of equipment or space!"
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Could be a lot stronger."
"However a degree does not necessarily mean the individual has adequate training, nor does the lack of a degree mean the individual does not. I have an advanced degree but have seen plenty of people with advanced degrees that are not adequately trained/ready for the position they occupy. Conversely I have had the privilege of working with Native American archaeologists with no degree/ no ability to attend college who could dig circles around a PhD."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"But this shouldn't preclude the involvement, if they wish, of Indigenous communities with a stake in a particular site etc."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Shitty fieldwork, shitty excavations results in  destruction of important archaeological data and resources."
"This seems inadequate. Training should not only be adequate to conduct research in a professional way, but trainers must respect trainees and not abuse or exploit them."
NA
NA
"The language is very focused on field excavation but should be expanded to specifically mention destructive sampling of excavated material for laboratory analyses (e.g., ancient DNA, isotopes, radiocarbon dates). In expanding this principle, it would again be beneficial to highlight the importance of memoranda of understanding with appropriate museums and efforts to avoid oversampling specific remains."
"Whether or not we like it, the Principles are weighted --- with #1 being the \"most important\". As we continue to train students and require field experience of them *in spite of the fact* that we are supposed to be treating the archaeological record as a non-renewable resource, this is something that really deserves to be fore-fronted. Guys, seriously: we have a shed-load of resources rotting away while we dig up new stuff. That \"we\" didn't make the problem is no excuse. The problem is ours."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Why are archaeologists self policing - 
Archaeologists must have the proper training before undertaking research."
NA
"Leaves the training as a matter of self-evaluation."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"We need to go further here. This seems to be directed towards academic archaeology, where the work is optional. We should include a statement that archaeologists should not undertake any work, including compliance archaeology, for which they are not prepared (either because of a lack of education on the topic, or a lack of resources to conduct the task in a timely manner). Archaeologists should be required to refer potential clients to other archaeologists or specialists if they themselves are not able to adequately handle the job."
NA
NA
NA
"Any destructive investigations must be assessed in consultation with descendant or other relevant communities when possible, in case destruction is unacceptable or must otherwise be avoided."
NA
"Would be nice if the SAA interfaced with RPA on this principle, such as by providing an example or encouraging archaeologists to become RPA. In convos with the SAA board, RPA has come up a LOT as their example of the overarching policing unit for when archaeologists do dumb stuff. If SAA continues to assume that RPA is doing all their investigating into harassment cases, lack of credentialling cases, etc., they should be up front and provide RPA as an example here."
"this is subjective and needs to be clarified. Pseudoscientists *believe* themselves to be qualified too."
NA
NA
"Archaeology students should get much more training and guidance toward using existing collections for Masters and PhD research. Also, archaeologists need much more formal training in education and outreach and collections management."
NA
NA
NA

"I believe it should be added that it is part of the responsibility of professional archaeologists to ensure that others (i.e., students or people working under them) get the training that they need."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"But this is definitely aspirational - only a few privileged researchers have adequate training AND experience AND facilities AND support - and they're certainly in academia, not CRM."
NA
"And that training must be made available to any and all that want it."
NA
"Need to add dissemination and collaboration here into the necessary skill set"
NA
NA
NA
NA
"This needs to be applied to field schools more."
NA
"Perhaps \"conduct and publish\"? -- i.e., it not just about the field and lab (which seems to be the focus as written), it's also about the reporting."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"It's a good principle, but it is valueless without being able to be enforced"
NA
NA
NA
"The main area where this principle is not actualized is the financial and institutional support necessary to curate what is excavated."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I think this is an area where all archaeologists can do better. I think continuing education programs are key."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I would like to see training include more on geological processes including erosion. Those of us who work in coastal areas need to learn more about how to recognize sites that are under imminent threat. At present, this is acquired as we go along and in consultation with other disciplines (which is actually a good thing), but I think we need to learn more about these processes too."
NA
"Do archaeologists have any ethical responsibility to help train, or at least support the training, of the people they work with?"
NA
NA
NA
NA
"But keep in mind that much cultural research work is conducted by volunteer groups, highly skilled, which is not destructive to the resource but, in fact, provides much knowledge of the resource that otherwise goes unrecorded. There seems to be much disparaging of this from academic circles. In fact, there seems at times to be a wide gulf between major academic institutions and others (archaeological programs by federal agencies and contract organizations).  Or, more exactly, between academic PhDs and others.

"We try to adhere to these principles, but there are notable cases in CRM where \"low bid\" or corporate connections have resulted in underqualified individuals pursuing both the field archaeology and analytic studies associated with projects. The only examples that come to mind are self-serving, but are nonetheless appropriate. Arizona-trained archaeologists trying to apply pottery typologies that they think are relevant but aren't in the analysis of New Mexico pottery collections, resulting in the inability of the data to contribution to regional questions of culture history. Also, Four Corners trained and experienced archaeologist applying well-established Four Corners interpretative models in settings where they are inappropriate (\"Ancestral Puebloan\" masks the need to create at least four completely distinct culture  histories from before the advent of pottery in the Southwest), resulting in the failure to perceive (in the data!) important variability."

Also, the focus is on \"research\".  There are other things that archaeologists and their partners do that aren't just research, like heritage uses, interpretation, compliance, historic preservation advocacy..."
NA
"No one disagreed with this principle, however it generated a lot of discussion. Is it ethical for departments to be churning out so many PhDs with emphasis on becoming an academic when academic jobs are so scarce?

"Good concept but there is a great range of training and skills, from excellent to substandard."
"This is a real issue in CRM and sometimes in academic contexts where people bite off more than they can chew. Often people have expertise for some types of sites and not others. Sometimes their bosses write the proposal and make presumptions that they can direct a project. Also this is very \"self assessment\" oriented. Some people are very confident and other question themselves and never feel they are ready. And the former set of people are more likely to create issues when they assume they are qualified. And there is a business pressure to assume qualification.


How can we write this in a way where people are more reflective of this and interrogate themselves a bit more? Maybe provide a list of especially challenging site types that are more complex? Provide a set of questions that people should ask themselves?"

"change \"destructive\" to \"consumptive.\" as worded it is negative and archaeological investigations work toward positive interactions and outcomes."
"Frame this differently. Yes, archaeology can be \"destructive\", but if done properly then the information gained likely outweighs the destruction. In other words, by framing it in a negative way like \"destructive\" it can paint a bad image, a negative connotation that we then pass along to the public. I've given many a public lecture where later someone says, \"if it's so destructive, why did you do it?\" So I've begun using the term consumptive, we're consuming the archaeological record (responsibly, and in limited fashion using geophysics and remote sensing) to answer specific and targeted research questions."

"I would strongly agree, especially with facilities and support, but training on the job without experience is vital too. Some of the best archaeologists I've worked with did not study or train for archaeology but were workers brought in and trained by on site archaeologists. Also most of what I learned while studying archaeology was of little use in the field, I learned on the job as much as anything. I don't think people who have an interest in archaeology should be turned away for lack of experience or training. Archaeologists should be liberal with their knowledge of excavation with anyone no matter there background. If someone is going to illegally excavate a site at least they may follow some basic principles of excavation if that information was more readily available."

"I struggle again here, as in other principles, by the fact that so much of the ethical burden (as it is represented) is placed on the victims of other people's neglect and selfishness. So many professors neglect to invest time in their graduate students, including with regard to their adequate training, which is usually justified by an attitude of \"if you're smart, you'll figure it out.\" Additionally, the enormous costs of attending field school have resulted in fewer students getting sufficient opportunities to refine their field techniques. The costs of field schools also proportionately disadvantage low-income students,  perpetuating the low population of Historically Underrepresented Groups in archaeologists.  To remediate this issue, anthropology departments should be encourage students to participate in salvage excavation projects (ie, when data recovery is a must, not a whim), possibly even developing relationship with local land management agencies and CRM archaeologists to create apprenticeship programs to that end. Such experiences should be accepted as fulfilling field school undergraduate major requirements"

In the USA, the majority of archaeological research is carried out under Section 106 of the NHPA and it has been my experience, over 40 years, that many federal/state agencies do not want to support this principle, but would rather select the lowest cost proposal to meet the minimum compliance which impacts an archaeologist's ability to adhere to this principle."

For example, studies of sites and their contents can be performed in the field, onsite.  Training in taking a more holistic view of site environments is needed, such as a cultural landscape approach.  I recommend more training for students and current professionals in techniques of oral history.  College archaeology students should take courses in local history, geology, ecology, botany, etc."

"According to a recent discussion on the Nat. Assoc of State Archs, this is a real problem.  I think this a ultimately a problem of grad schools (not) teaching ethics because I think there is a perception that if you get a MA/PhD degree, then you're qualified to do archaeology anywhere of any kind.  And it is something I see in my job all the time, folks not having the experience/training to tackle specific types of sites.  From the standpoint of an 'ethical standard', not really sure what can be done about it."

"This may be an unpopular opinion but I think that this principle is too important to rely on Field Schools to teach students- Field School programs are increasingly expensive and many undergraduate programs are overly focused on sending students abroad to \"exciting\" places rather than focusing on the skills that are most necessary- in this way I think that more undergrad programs should have classes geared towards training students with field methods so that they are ready to hop into a career even if they can't afford a proper field school. Students are already spending thousands of dollars on college and with the dominant discourse suggesting that anthropology degrees are \"useless\" or \"not worth the money\", expecting students to shell out more cash to actually learn field methods is a barrier for more people to get into the field"

It is not enough to have materials on hand; one must use them. I could provide numerous examples, especially in CRM contexts, where archaeologists declined to use the full resources available to them to do good archaeology, because it was easier/faster/cheaper to do a subpar job. Anyone involved in CRM can name at least one group in their region that commonly operates in this manner; these organizations should be held to account."

"Sadly, this is not the case. In the cultural resource industry, most archaeologists have bowed down to clients and their bosses desire to get more work, and have put ethics on the back burner. If an agency wants to blow off archaeological monitoring services or lessen them, the archaeologist doesn't fight back to be the steward they need to be.Additionally, this can be easily corrected by having archaeologists work only for archaeological companies and not multi-faceted large environmental firms that only have a few archaeologists on staff and only want to make a buck. The large environmental firms do not have the integrity in them that the standalone archaeological firms have. It should all be about the cultural resources and not money."
NA
"Do we (as a field/discipline) have anything in place to address instances where colleagues are falling short of this?"
NA
"Needs more elaboration.  Much archaeological work is done as a result of chance or inopportune discoveries that seldom have any kind of financial backing to support salvage retrieval, let alone analysis, curation, and reporting.   This is certainly an  \"aspirational\" goal, but reality often requires hard decisions to be made a very short periods of time."
NA

"I do not think this principle is framed well. Students need to be trained well regardless of whether a discipline is destructive. I think we should state that members have a duty to ensure that their trainees are prepared to conduct research and, if we must, only mention the destructive nature of the discipline as an additional reason this is an ethical imperative. Our duty to students is not dependent on that."

"There could be an emphasis on continuing education in this principle.

"this principle could be made stronger and more compelling, while I don't have specific wording to suggest, perhaps referencing existing federal/state/province law regarding both qualifications and training, but also official repositories of the archaeological record in nations would be a place to start, or at least reference"
"Given that archaeological process is destructive, this should be a lot longer of a definition. Regarding what \"adequate training, experience, facilities, and other support necessary\" is very open ended and vague. Some could interpret this to rationalize their looting practices. This definition should include training in academia to some degree."

"There's a piece missing here, which is funding for curation and write up. In the grants of which I have been a part, funding for the final stages of research were considered to be someone else's responsibility, not that of the research funders. This makes compliance with this ethical standard difficult for everyone - from university colleagues who must wedge the writing and curation parts in amongst all their other duties, and from my experience as a graduate student or independent researcher - doing it for free and/or at personal expense. If we recognize these components are essential to ethical archaeological practice, they MUST be properly funded."
