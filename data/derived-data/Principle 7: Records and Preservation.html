That's like saying hobby metal detectorists are just as good at doing archaeology as archaeologists are. It's hard to convince archaeologists to spend money, but it's unconscionable to pretend that the same rules of professionalism and training that apply to being allowed to be called a professional archaeologist somehow don't apply to scientific field of conservation.

  <tr> <td align="right"> 247 </td> <td> What can I say? Our little unexceptional U Hawaii archaeology program has spent the better part of the last decade documenting and repatriating old collections to Pacific and Asian localities from whence they came, because I pushed for it. And lots of colleagues hated me for pushing: but I was following Principle 7 of the SAA Ethics code, and they couldn't prevail.

I will add that host countries, while grappling with their own collections management issues, have largely welcomed the repatriations. And the fact that we've repatriated collections puts pressure on archaeological colleagues with collections at their home institutions to repatriate: a good thing.

But it would be nice if this were standard professional practice, rather than responses to a crabby sanctimonious archaeological colleague like me. :-) </td> </tr>

Theft of museum property is a big one and I have  initiated a task group to address the underdeveloped nexus between Curation and ARPA. In another area, some federal agencies (USACOE in particular) is restricting collection of artifacts (including diagnostics) on the part of its contractors in order to avoid curatorial costs. I get not bringing in another truckload of metates, but the importance of long-term curation is in jeopardy with this sort of action. Also, I question the quality of "analysis" that goes on in the field under a restriction like this. There are also legal questions associated: If there is a decision to not proceed with a phase 2 or phase 3 level of action, how can it be verified if questioned? The tribes and federal archeologists I have talked to about this are not happy. </td> </tr>

An extreme example: The entire scientific legacy of Dr. Robert DuBois, the founder of archaeomagnetic dating in the western hemisphere, was slated to be disposed of in the landfill in Oklahoma City by the geophysics department and by his heirs. I became aware of the situation, and I was given two weeks to act. I was able to get a donor to provide funds for a moving truck, and I and two volunteers ended up rescuing 6 tons of samples, records, and equipment from destruction. Now that legacy is being prepared for use by the geophysics community as part of their world-wide modeling of the earth's magnetic field, but I have yet to see expressions of interest from the archaeological community ... we'll see. </td> </tr>

The 1st sentence should use "associated records as defined in 36 CFR 79" instead of "records".  Although those regulations are for federal collections, SAA could use that definition for all the "records" it refers to in its ethics since it is the most comprehensive definition out there.

2nd sentence: 1) add to the list of people to encourage so it says "colleagues, students,  descendant communities, teachers, advocationalists, collectors, and others"; 2) "in their research" should also include "in their research, heritage uses, and teaching"; 3) is much too long overall so should be rewritten as 2 sentences.

Again, the discussion was similar to that of Principle No 1 -- our priority is to the archaeological record, and not to the descendants, and so we should preserve archaeological data regardless of potential consequences.  Also, some folks revisited Principle No 5 and intellectual property and who has the right to use and interpret the data and also stewardship of records and preservations before PIs die or retire. Despite folks apparent disagreement with any type of censorship of records and preservation of records, there appeared to be general agreement that access to some records may restricted to professionals with a need to know.  Also, there seemed to be general agreement that things like burials should maybe not be shown during a power point presentation.  

Based on how all over the discussion was, my opinion is that this Principle should probably be rewritten and clarified. </td> </tr>

Or is it:

"...they should encourage colleagues, students, and others to make responsible use of collections, records, and reports in their research as one means of...increasing the care and attention given to that portion of the archaeological record..."?
