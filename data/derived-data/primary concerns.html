The SAA administration demonstrated that ethics were not of importance as they attempted to put the onus of the issue on a University instead of taking the time to address it. I think that the person handling social media at the time as well - I believe Oona - was blocking people on twitter and that violates our right to critique the SAA's as an institution. Rather than going about it in an ethical way, it showed the lack of support for women and Indigenous archaeologists that make up a majority of those in the field. </td> </tr>

NAGPRA compliance should be the number one concern of our field and professional organization, it should be absolutely unacceptable to have institutions, firms, and individuals drag their feet on NAGPRA.

Harassment of all kinds is endemic to archaeology and there must be zero tolerance for it in any archaeological venue or arena.

Improving relations with the public

Domination of professional archaeology sectors by a small handful of people connected to the same networks (i.e. SRI / SRIF / CfAS / LEAP / ARCUS). There's a real ethical need to broaden out who we listen to and support within professional archaeology.

Ensuring safe working conditions and fair labor practices for all working archaeologists, including a living wage for all full-time archaeologists (in all areas, i.e. academic, govt, private sector, etc.) </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td align="right"> 10 </td> <td> I see gender-based and sexual harassment as vital concerns, within the broader context of often abusive power relationships in academia, the workplace and the insular experience of fieldwork.

As job opportunities have become more scarce and also of lower quality (impermanent, part-time, low-paid, highly demanding), issues caused by systematic abuse of power by supervisors have deepened, and willingness to defend oneself or others has been eroded.

While I perceive the involvement of archaeologists in owning or even trafficking antiquities to have greatly lessened, I perceive that traffickers and collectors are becoming bolder recently and are challenging the authority of archaeologists, within a broader framework of fomenting disrespect for science and professional standards. We need to strategize about dealing with this.

Legal protections for heritage sites are being challenged, eroded and undone, and SAA has responded appropriately to work against these attacks. This situation requires further education and skill-building, both within and beyond our discipline. </td> </tr>

So many of the @MeToo stories began with the woman drunk to the point of being unable to move, or passed out, and in that state, sexually assaulted.  This should not be swept under the rug in discussions of sexual harassment and exploitation.
3) again, revealed in the @MeToo sessions:  making it obligatory for directors of projects outside the U.S. and Canada, to spend a bloc of time explaining the host country's mores and customs.  Some of the @MeToo stories seemed to be American women misinterpreting customary courtesies and pleasantries of other socieites.

  <tr> <td align="right"> 53 </td> <td> in no order:

1) How we as archaeologists treat each other; specifically, as conversations about interpersonal abuses of power (sexual harassment, labor exploitation, unsafe work conditions) become more public, there is a need for clear and firm standards that can hold archaeologists at all ranks accountable for illegal and uncollegial behavior.

2) Our relations with stakeholder communities, including but not limited to descendants, who have a vested interest in and are exposed to present-day social and political and economic risk by archaeological and heritage projects.

3) New challenges in digital archaeology, related to data sharing and data preservation, etc.

4) Preservation of the archaeological record, not only sites and landscapes but especially collections which have been given little ethical attention and as a result, are routinely exposed to risk of damage and loss. I am still so horrified that archaeologists excavate or conduct survey without being required to pre-identify and pre-pay for permanent curation of artifacts, samples, and data.

It seems to me this a fundamental problem, because outside folks are not necessarily focused on our goals. Thus, obligations are one-sided and we cannot expect others to act similarly. That's a structural problem. 

The conflict goes to the heart of the primary goals of archaeology, which I believe is to get to an objective truth, although we will likely never get there. Nonetheless, the goal is important to me, and if I was just story-telling, I wouldn't do it. This runs smack dab against the idea of accommodating other interpretations to incorporate other versions of the "truth." This goes beyond trivial examples like accommodating a biblical literalist's truth about the age of the earth. Tribes, religions, collectors, nations, past peoples and on and on - they all are affected by what we do.

It's a very complex problem, and it stems in part from an anthropological view of culture as something that is recreated constantly, incorporating and discarding parts in the process. If a culture's past is recreated in the present, then that becomes it's "truth." If that's its present view, and we are required to incorporate it into our discipline, then we will, on occasion, have to discard our primary goal.

Having said all that, I do believe we must "seriously consider" other viewpoints, however that is defined. It is both an ethic and simple politeness. But if truth is the goal, then other viewpoints will always be judged, and sometimes judged as having no value. Probably, most of the time it will not cause much conflict. The problem is when the interpretation of the ethic is that the conflict requires an archaeologist to discard the primary truth goal. 

Sorry for the preachy tone.

Setting this challenge aside (as it is being addressed by SAA in other venues), the primary ethical concern that I encounter on regular basis in my work as a public (CRM/professional) archaeologist is the lack of professional standards. There are two issues of professionalism in the field that concern me. 

The first is the quality of training at the undergraduate and MA levels. I would not describe the current status of archaeological education as "adequate" under Principle 8. BAs do not prepare students to work in the field. In my experience, MA standards are also often so low that recent graduates are unable to accomplish basic necessary work (e.g. fully recording their excavations, hand-mapping, setting up excavation units, calculating distances in relationship to data, etc.). As a result, CRM professionals are often not empowered to challenge unethical behavior because their training has not equipped them to evaluate the boundary between good and bad practice. This cultivates the attitude that "that's the way things are done" in the field, another factor encouraging a culture of silence that has numerous other negative effects (now well-documented). Add onto this the precarity of employment among entry- and early-professional-level archaeologists, and it is impossible to expect good practice to result.

The second issue of professionalism is the lack of publication in peer-reviewed venues. I do not believe that Principle 6 adequately addresses the most important underlying imperative for peer-review: oversight of practice by qualified outsiders. If data recovery projects are undertaken to preserve archaeological data as a mitigation measure, it is difficult to justify them if the data they produce are rarely (or never) evaluated in the literature. When CRM projects are reviewed by other CRM professionals only, and the field lacks a single, necessary venue for dissemination of this type of archaeological data (in the form of appropriate peer-reviewed journals accessible to all professional archaeologists), then unqualified or unscrupulous archaeologists can continue to practice. Beyond that, they can do so with a competitive advantage because of their ingorance of good practice and/or their willingness to ignore their duties. This implicates the entire field's responsibility to the archaeological record (under Principle No. 1) and to the public (under Principle No. 2).

-

Another ethical concern that I regularly encounter is the unrealistic assumptions about what a career in the field looks like in 2020. University-based research and teaching faculty at 2- and 4-year institutions train students, but they usually do not prepare them to work as archaeologists. A single field school is not sufficient preparation for field practice, and does not satisfy Principle No. 8. As a result, BAs are expected to learn on the fly in CRM. The very tight schedules and the very low budgets do not leave room for learning on the job. The result is a workforce of seasonal/hourly BAs, undertrained and overqualified (on paper). 

The underlying ethical concern, however, is how the field treats those individuals. A new graduate can reasonably be expected to have five figures of student debt (or more, if they have attended some amount graduate school [whether they completed their course of study or not]). They are then expected to spend multiple years gaining CRM experience as hourly or project-specific employees, subject to schedules outside of their control and often without access to support in the form of healthcare or other employment benefits. This set of affairs is excellent - for the owners of CRM companies who can exploit their employees without having any responsiblity to them, for the academic archaeologists who rely on unpaid labor to generate data for publications, and for the industries that seek out the least-qualified consultants they can to conduct "oversight" of their projects. 

The field must dedicate more care to training new archaeologists at every level and to ensuring that the next generation has the opportunity to succeed. The over-production of BA and MA students and the lack of opportunties for the overwhelming majority of them is shameful. The unrealistic expectations of students, who do not know any better, and academic archaeologists, who do know better, must change. Given my experiences, I ask myself why the field should expect to attract and retain talented young students who will perform their professional duties ethically. And this is not only a question of professional ethics or of ensuring the robustness of archaeology in the future. It is even more fundamentally a question of decency and morality. </td> </tr>

Students who take on graduate studies are not guaranteed professional relationships with mentors and colleagues. 

Academic professors are not vetted for there ability to foster professional mentorships and/or to provide a certain standard of academic guidance and caregiving to the students they have accepted.

Professors/academic staff seemingly have free reign to weed out students who are not "immediately participatory in" and/or "fully adept at" any necessary departmental politics. Students who are prone to think critically, and independently or students who seek the full boundaries and characteristics of collegial atmosphere may be steered out of academic programs. 
Archaeology/anthropology professional relations are not taught or reviewed in undergraduate studies.

Archaeology/Anthropology graduate studies can be an extreme investment financially, personally and professionally and student debt is at and all time high. These circumstances can disproportionately affect nontraditional students, or those students that are the first in their family to seek a higher education - PhD. or M.A.

2 ) ON CALL ARCHAEOLOGY
I am unfamiliar with the circumstance in most states but in one of the most expensive states to reside "On Call" or gig archaeology employment is in many cases the only opportunity for employment in the discipline. Having participated in "On call" archaeology for 5 years after gaining my M.A. degree and having worked full time in Archaeology/CRM for 3 years post B.A. and before the M.A., I believe I can offer important insight.
Companies that provide on-call archaeology opportunities take zero responsibility in the unfortunate circumstances and short and long term health and lifestyle effects of this type employment. They offer no increased wages/compensation for this "on the fly" and often last minute request for field staff and immediate project/client responsive deployments. Many times field deployments are into extremely harsh and totally unfamiliar work environments for unknown amounts of time and they put stress on personal health and personal/family relationships. Many deployments put personal safety in a whole different category as a result of unfamiliar work and living arrangements. From my observations other on call archaeologists (M.A./B.A) who may be desperate for steady work may chose unsafe work relations mistakenly placed in the category of "a competitive work environment" in order to prevail as the higher performing employee.  

Many of the companies providing these opportunities seemingly adopt a "good doer" or "employment proving hero" type of attitude by saving you from periods of unemployment. In reality they are capitalizing as much as possible as a result of this gig economy and they are perhaps normalizing one of the most unfortunate aspects of this career. In reality many of the supervisors of on call employment have little to know knowledge of the circumstances of this type of employment, as it's possible many have never operated as on call archaeologists. In addition the on call field archaeologist can provide higher quality and better responsive field archaeology then the supervisors can guide or recommend. Or they are providing a work talent that is difficult to find but completely underappreciated and under-compensated for. Supervisors may be much more recent company hires as a result of their client relations or computer/gis skills. Full time employment is thereby gained as result of having clients that you bring in as a new hire and may have nothing to do with quality work or dedicated on call response with a particular company.

 "On call" opportunities typically provide no guaranteed compensation for all the pre-deployment correspondence/scheduling, the many work supplies (dig kit/recordation material), the storage for all these supplies including personal PPE during gaps between work, the yearly resume updating, or the necessary timecard and expense processing. Because many clients or companies require receipts for food expense reimbursement there can be zero privacy in personal food purchase and consumption.
On call archaeologists can make no long term planning and or important financial decisions about their lifestyle as a result of unpredictable work opportunity.

These circumstances mandate a closer look at the trajectory of employment in the field of cultural resource management, and whether CRM can be a self respecting and mentally healthy career opportunity and feasible career choice. If this status quo continues more transparency is needed about the characteristics of the lifestyle before students pursue academic studies gearing them in to this direction. Also, companies should be confronted about their part in the exploitative circumstance.

I have recently started a new small business and one of my top priorities is to address this exploitative circumstance. I hope to offer public and community archaeology education outreach and or indigenous archaeology as additions to CRM projects throughout the year and thereby minimize on call employment or seasonal work. If there are grants or other funding opportunities for these diverse employment opportunities and engagements and SAA can help facilitate this please highlight this information in future SAA updates and opportunities.

3) Many academic archeologists do not train their students to do CRM or applied anthropology and archeology and seem to just do book learning;
4) There are too many legacy collections in storage outside of their country of origin and poorly stored.  A good field archeologist does not equal a good caretaker of collections;
5) The dichotomy and ranking between field and lab/collections archaeologists, as well as the "true" archeology being field work while caring for the data is considered less than.  We are either stewards of history and prehistory or we are not;

  <tr> <td align="right"> 452 </td> <td> There are many ethical concerns in the field, and the current SAA Principles cover many of them. But there are several areas where the current principles do not go far enough. Principle Number 9, for instance, says that archaeologists are responsible to know the laws and policies of their home nations and institutional workplaces, and to abide by them. But this implies a narrow legalistic approach that does not respond adequately to the range of behaviors that can create hostile or just unpleasant work environments for many (especially junior) archaeologists.  Avoiding any sort of harassment, bullying, or discrimination against coworkers, subordinates, or colleagues should be a principle of archaeological ethics, regardless of any particular nation's or institution's policies. This principle is especially important in archaeology, where field research often creates social situations where it can seem that normal rules of social interaction do not apply (though problems can arise in any academic or work setting, not just in the field). Supervisors and organizations have a responsibility to not just avoid harassing or bullying subordinates, but have an ethical responsibility to deliberately create an environment where such behavior is not tolerated and all participants can participate safely. 

The non-harassment, non-bullying ethical principle should also extend to peer reviews. Critical reviews are sometimes warranted, but using the cover of anonymity to attack and insult authors or unfairly characterize their work (or to unreasonably promote the reviewer's work) is both common and deeply unethical. It should be explicitly covered in the SAA Principles, and SAA should ensure that reviewers for the society's journals do not engage in such abuse.

I also would argue that depite the current Principles 6 and 7 (concerning reporting and data sharing), there are ethical concerns surrounding data availability and replicability of analyses. SAA should push for open science policies for archaeological data, to the greatest extent possible. There are, of course, issues with site location data, but whenever articles are published, data (and code related to analysis) should be made available. SAA could and should do much more to promote this kind of data sharing (by requiring a data sharing statement with every article published in the society's journals, for instance).

I understand it is hard to publish in a timely fashion (I am certainly an offender, as I think most of us are), but at some point a scholar should cede partial or total control of a project/assemblage, and not hoard data.

Another area is regarding the submission of data and reports from CRM firms whose contracted fieldwork may have been ended due to a lack of funding or a change in development plans, and whether or not such work can be considered contractually owned by the individual/corporation that originally paid for the work, and whether archaeologists have sufficient legal basis to ensure that even cancelled project reports and/or data must be filed with at least their respective state archaeological site files office.  In other words, can a contracted report and data be held back from any public view even after the work has been completed (and those affected parts of any site already destroyed by excavation). </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td align="right"> 498 </td> <td> Since my professional involvement with archeology is now based on a career as a federal archeologist heavily involved in the teaching and implementation of ARPA and NAGPRA, my concern is where archeologists have seen fit to find commercial opportunities as Subject Matter Experts for the defense in criminal cases taking place on federal and Indian lands. We have seen the impact of section 106 of NHPA as a commercial enterprise, and I acknowledge that the federal government was and is unprepared to meet the ongoing challenge of 106 without private sector assistance. But I fear that ARPA and NAGPRA will become a "cash cow" for some archeologists. While I support fully our legal system's due process, those cases in which I have been involved showed a lack of concern on the part of archeologists working for the defense for substantive efforts in their side of case management. In other words, it looks to me like they are just out for the money. Attacking in court a Damage Assessment document prepared by a federal or Indian archeologist is, I suppose, fair game, but the notion that archeologists may find a source of income from this troubles me greatly and I firmly believe that it falls into the category of "unethical." </td> </tr>

Bias in grant proposals and reviews still exists. Many times in grant meetings I hear that the proposal needs to be sent to "Bill, Ted, Fred, and Joe" for review. And I say: "Mary, Jane, Sue, and Anne would also be excellent reviewers." And people say, "Oh, yes, them too." Females, even highly accomplished ones, are often an afterthought.

Lack of mentorship for graduate students and poor preparation for a variety of careers. Too many faculty see that the only "real" job is a tenure-track one, and even *years* after their former students have become successful in a variety of careers the faculty mentor will let out a deep sigh about how it was "too bad" that so-and-so "never got a job" as if the only worthwhile job is in an R1 (full disclosure: I teach in an R1, and often find myself to be the only faculty member who is willing to proactively talk to grad students about job variety).

Tribal participation and leadership in excavating prehistoric sites are still the exception, not the rule. Archaeology is a tool that is a necessary precursor to project development often, and too often the standards of CRM are not high enough. Tribal history is mangled through outdated boilerplate language, lack of time, or any number of factors. Same may go for some sites with special significance for historical minority communities, religious groups, women, and LGBT contexts. This is a structural issue of bad CRM budgets for atypical projects that may take more time and care to research and analyze. It is ethically bad, and it reduces the impact and significance of our work for these communities.

Publication: This is an old ethical issue that continues to be unaddressed. Projects frequently get dropped by the field personnnel due to priorities, change in career, loss of institutional support, whatever. We need to as a discipline ensure that at a minimum field reports are always completed. Repositories should all know which collections have been written up, to what degree, and finishing these reports should be prioritized over new fieldwork more often (i.e. in all cases unless the fieldwork is to address an imminent threat). 

SAA hostility to many of its members: This doesn't need to go in our Code, but there needs to be substantial structural change in how the SAA as an organization sees its responsibilities to the discipline and its members. This predates last year's conference debacle, but was reflected in it.  SAA is sitting on a stockpile of $8 million. We are in an international crisis. Groups like AAA are doing emergency loans and sharing the wealth. SAA is writing emails that provide their members with the option of asking for a refund for the 2020 conference, but the language was mealy and seemed designed to shame people into not requesting a refund. SAA seems to make a lot of its decisions based on what is easy and safe for the organization, not what is needed to protect people (the women at least year's conference) or make the discipline grow. Without commitment within the organization's staff and leadership, the Ethical principles overhaul is going to end up stuck in a committee that is not empowered to pass a set of ethical principles unless the staff and board support it. Given the decisionmaking by executive leadership over the last year, I do not want them making ethics-based decisions. </td> </tr>

CRM, academic, and state and federal archaeologists regularly recommend (and often say that they have determined) that no historic properties will be effected by undertakings if significant archaeological resources are not found during a survey. Even when Tribe have identified ethnographic resources or TCPs, many archaeologists insist that they have addressed Tribal concerns through archaeology, or by noting that popular collections of Indian legends don't mention their project area. Further, many CRM firms recommend archaeological monitoring during projects, even when the concern is for ethnographic landscape or other resource values important to Tribes. 

This outrageous behavior serves the business interests of archaeologists, and creates busy work to keep archaeologists employed. It does not, however, benefit the resources or tribal communities for whom they hold value, and the SAA needs to discourage their members from doing this. 

Many archaeologists also insist that working with looters is ethical, since looted collections may still have scientific value. However, this again discounts the value that ancestral sites and resources have to tribal communities. </td> </tr>

I have found, for example, numerous instances of archaeologists using pedestrian surveys to speak to the likelihood of sub-surface cultural resources. I have seen archaeologists more concerned about their employer's budget than they are (which is saying something) and using that as a reason to resist doing any archaeological testing (only pedestrian survey and monitoring). If they do test, many only want to use augers, even in highly sensitive archaeological sites. I see archaeologists propose collecting artifacts during surveys and testing when there is no budget for analysis, curation, or reburial. I also see CRM archaeologists routinely use boilerplate historical/ethnographic background sections more brazenly plagiarized than almost anything I experienced teaching undergrads for five years. At times, the ethnographic background sections are taken from other reports that were clearly located elsewhere in California. Some (though not all) have a very adversarial relationship with local tribal communities. In short, as the SHPO has no set standards for CRM work, the result has been a prolonged "race to the bottom" quality-wise. 

In academia, the lack of community-based participatory research is distressing. The practice of individual archaeologists and academic institutions buying land for the purposes of excavating without having to answer to the local community should be banned. </td> </tr>

Lesson:
An area that is survey will look different from year to year and season to season - some plants only bloom every few years or maybe every ten years, it is difficult even for me to comment on an area when it is being surveyed for development, but it is necessary to consider vegetation, history, visual landscapes and the overall holistic approach.

Secondly is the need to collect artifacts - it needs to stop. I have worked with the Public Lands Commission in California and requested that if artifacts need to be moved that California Transportation (CalTrans) allow the Native American community determine how, when and where to put them during a 4 lane highway extension.

Curation and study are not going to restore our heritage - curation creates a money and staffing problem for several agencies - why not allow Natives decided what happens to artifacts? </td> </tr>

Bioarchaeological research presents a multitude of ethical concerns. The SAA should take a stance against studies such as Ancient DNA, skeletal isotopes, etc. which are conducted on human remains without the consent of and collaboration with relevant living communities. NAGPRA protects many Native American remains in the United States, but many more fall outside its purview. The potential legality of many such studies does not make them ethically sound. Furthermore, in much of Latin America and many other areas of the world, no such protections exist. In these cases, the code of ethics may be the only guidelines influencing these studies. Therefore it is important for the code of ethics to have strong guidance in this regard. 

Another ethical concern is challenging the myth of archaeological stewardship as a justification unto itself for archaeological research. Stewardship as a concept needs to be interrogated. I do not believe that this should be given primacy in our code of ethics. 

I think it should be stressed as an ethical imperative that we address the difficult social and political history of archaeology, especially its colonial origins and continued ties to colonial and capitalist practice when teaching archaeology to various publics and training new archaeologists. </td> </tr>

I know that is what the task force is taking into consideration.

Not really a problem for most 106 projects as that process usually (!) manages to include the right players in a timely way.  But I think archaeologists still have a significant challenge consulting with tribal communities on non-106 projects.  There is still a strong tendency to develop the project scope and plan of operation before reaching out to other possible partners and asking them to join.  This doesn't provide them the opportunity to join in the development and help make the project what they want it to be.
At the same time, while my current role is telling archaeologists how they can meet the SHPO's expectations while accommodating tribal expectations as well, if I were to develop my own personal research project (retirement?), I would certainly let the appropriate Tribes know of my plans, but I am not sure how I would react if one or more of them had significant concerns about the proposal.  Certainly would talk with them about it, but at what level am i willing to give them veto power over what I do - no answer to this (yet).

One of the standard phrases in 106 is 'making a reasonable and good faith effort'.  it is not always clear what that should entail.  While our office has developed field and report standards as one means to address that, you can't cover every situation.  what are the ethical implications of this standard?
Where I run into this often is in dealing with unmarked and abandoned cemeteries.  What level of effort is 'right' when trying to find descendent communities who should participate in decisions impacting their ancestors graves (tribal, slave, or other).  Especially in the case of slave or 19th century rural family cemeteries where there is no obvious descendent population?
I often find myself thinking of the 'reasonable and good faith' standard as essentially coming down to "can I defend my actions in court".  Have never been called into court to defend, but this is how i often find myself assessing the effort.  Is the fear of court a reasonable ethical standard to use? </td> </tr>

The sustainability of our archaeological undertaking needs more attention, particularly on the subject of stewarding collections and supporting documentation in perpetuity. More advocacy for collections holding institutions and the resources that they need is essential to preserve the archaeological record.

In the first go round of the Ethical Principles--there was not a principle of scholarship and integrity. I have always found that to be a glaring oversight given it is a basic tenant of the education we all received, but never explicitly enshrined in the principles.

There are still inherent inequities in the academy, in agencies, and in other organizations where archaeologists work. There is still much to do in creating fair professional relationships between those in the profession whose positions grant them more power over those whose positions place them in positions of less power, particularly with regards to the access of opportunities and resources. </td> </tr>

For the field/science itself I think that stewardship and public education/outreach are primary ethical concerns. Stewardship on all fronts would be improved if all archaeologists were invested in public education and outreach (I'm thinking in particular of in situ archaeological protection and conservation). I also believe that not enough archaeologists are invested in the long-term protection of the archaeological record after it has been dug up.... collection management is something that all of us should be invested in. </td> </tr>

Firms low-balling bids to get work and then not having the proper funds to complete the work to standards so they don't. We don't see the local, state, or federal agencies holding these firms to the standards and calling them out for blatantly not meeting them. It is devastating to see the poor work from these firms allowing the destruction of important cultural resources. It is frustrating to watch sites that we have recorded and know will be significant given to these firms, who charge half the cost, for further study and immediately deem these sites insignificant to please the client. And it is even more frustrating that these same companies become a joke among other firms for the poor quality of their work, and yet agencies, at all levels, continue to do nothing. 
Exacerbating this situation is the lack of funding in general that pushes the field to use volunteers to do what should be considered skilled tasks. And while I love and sincerely appreciate the work that volunteers do and realize that some will come to know more than many trained professionals, that is the exception. We devalue our education, training, and expertise when we use volunteers to do a majority of the work because we are not given funding. And we encourage continued under funding by promising we can find volunteers to do the same work for free. 
The lack of funding and use of volunteers also means that field techs can be treated as disposable...people to be worked until they break for low pay, temporary employment, and no benefits. All of these issues contribute to the continued "race to the bottom" that does a disservice to our entire field by eroding the trust of the clients who wonder why one firm can do what they see as the same work for much less and with better result (no further work needed); the agencies, with whom we must negotiate the least amount of work for the least amount of money for those clients; and the public, who expects us to protect cultural resources. </td> </tr>

  <tr> <td align="right"> 1367 </td> <td> It's hard to limit myself to on primary ethical concern, so I've listed my top concerns in no particular order:

Accessibility: It has become evident to me that archaeology is not always accessible to a variety of stakeholder, particular indigenous and historically marginalized groups, to low-income students, and people with disabilities. I have a lower middle class background and while I was able to pay for my fieldschool, it was a financial burden. This seems to be the case for many, and there are many others who would like to pursue fieldschools but can't due to the cost. I think there needs to be a concerted effort to fund training for individuals interested in archaeology but can't afford the costs associated with traditional archaeological fieldschools/training.

Safe working environment: After last year's SAA meetings, the recent story about the Harvard Anthropology department, and numerous other examples it has become widely known that there is an issue of sexual harassment and abuse within archaeology. I do think this is changing as more people have become aware of it, but this seems to be a long-standing issue in archaeology, tied particularly to the hierarchical power structure of academia and field research. 

Merging engagement and scientific research: I personally see archaeology as a scientific endeavor. However, this does not mean that I think archaeology is apolitical, or mutually exclusive from collaborative/engaged archaeology and working with native communities. However, there seems to be rift developing where archaeologists either have to be fully immersed and dedicated to engagement, or objective scientists that do have little to no interaction with native groups. I do not think there needs to be such a stark divide. This pertains especially to ancient DNA. I think it is possible to conduct ancient DNA studies that are both scientifically grounded and meet ethical standards for working with human remains </td> </tr>

Also something on our mind is repatriation of looted objects, as well as preventing the art market from fueling further looting (which can end up funding violence and political corruption in our regions as well).

From when I was 10+ years ago, I was aware of concerns with how archaeologists managed their work in response to pressures from developers (pressure being to not see things, not report them, not require monitors, and similar); how archaeologists respected and interacted with stakeholders and associated communities (appropriate consultation); and ensuring good documentation and curation of the sites we work on and materials we collect (particularly under strained budgets and pressures from developers). I expect these pressures still exist, but I can't speak to them directly.

Publication concerns such as plagiarism and appropriate use/purchase of publications for teaching are perennial, but have also taken new shapes in our more digital world. I wouldn't call them the major issues, but because they are essential to building both careers and trust within the profession, they should be called out for attention more often than they currently are.

Gender-based harassment and discrimination are major issue and ones I know the SAA has been/is struggling with. We need constant vigilance for these, and an ethical culture that creates equality (at minimum) for those who report having been harmed by them.

We are also living in an era of climate change and - as I type - a US that may finally be waking up to its centuries of racial inequality and discrimination. We should ensure that our ethical principles require clear and equal (at minimum) attention to communities and peoples whose voices have been muffled. While ethical principles should not prescribe research topics or products, archaeologists should ensure that our science is clear and accessible with respect to major issues facing society. It may also become an ethical issue to ensure that equitable portions of archaeological effort are divided between basic research and research that is applied to major issues facing society. </td> </tr>

Personally I feel that accountability is the most important ethical concern because of the social and political implications for our society and field at large. Anthropology and archaeology are inherently colonial, and I do not think all archaeologists recognize this or necessarily know how to make sure that they are accountable to affected groups (especially indigenous groups) when ideas come into conflict.
That said, I also think that stewardship is a hugely pressing ethical concern. We are often more focused on the in situ archaeological record, including the protection of archaeological sites and the prevention of looting, etc. This is somewhat ironic when many archaeologists don't take the time to fully engage in public education and outreach in an effort to mitigate this problem. As much as in situ preservation is an integral component of stewardship, it is only a portion of the archaeological record and I think overemphasizing this portion of the record is a severe detriment to the stewardship and management of archaeological materials held in collections. Proposals need to include detailed and long-term stewardship/collection management plans. </td> </tr>

  <tr> <td align="right"> 1524 </td> <td> the continued use of distancing language the creates positionality of direct and/or indirect power structures (dominate/suppressed).  Past generations of professional, particularly in anthropology and archaeology, by the nature of the academic process create 'specialists' and 'experts on the subject of Other people (their lives, belongings, thoughts, etc.).  The development of Codes of Ethics by- and for- these same experts reaffirms positionality.  Repeatedly the result is an academic Expert makes a declarative statement "X is true!" and the Tribe or decedents of the 'subject people' says, "No, that is not true.  This is true!".  Immediately there is a conflict.  Additionally, 'experts' will chose to research a subject that is taboo to a community and perceived to be inappropriate to be discussed by the uninitiated.  Those communities have no control over the dispersal of that information and are left vulnerable and even sensationalized.  

Today's Tribes and Indigenous nations have withstood plagues, systematic genocide, reservations, and educational systems, all designed to remove them from existence.  there for what is held in community (knowledge, language, understanding, belongings, etc.) is highly intimate and protected.  When specialists flex their expertise it is a dominating act.  When Codes of Ethics are developed one-on-one with the nations with whom you work there will begin to be a balanced understanding of HOW to proceed.  for example, the current code (Intellectual Property) does not recognize that information may originate with a Tribe who may not be comfortable with it being shared outside of community. </td> </tr>
