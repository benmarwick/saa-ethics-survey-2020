  <tr> <td align="right"> 6 </td> <td> This principle falls short on two fronts. One, there are some kinds of information that collaborators and stakeholders may request that we never make public, based on their rights to privacy or cultural patrimony. Two, for the less sensitive information that constitutes the majority of data that archaeologists produced, "limited and reasonable" is ambiguous enough that it allows bad actors to hold on to data virtually in perpetuity. So there need to be more clear implications here -- guidelines about what kinds of datasets and workflows to make publically available and how to do it. And I think that we should require the primary datasets AND processing workflows referred to in all SAA journals to be made public, UNLESS the authors can clearly cite some ethical concern about their publication. We should also look into preregistering hypotheses before studies begin as a way to increase transparency in research design. </td> </tr>

  <tr> <td align="right"> 37 </td> <td> Again, this is woefully inadequate and incomplete.

The ethical problems of draconian copyright laws and the intrusive surveillance of commercial digital publishing platforms (not to mention social media platforms) get very little attention and discussion in the SAA.

Commercial archaeology largely generates commercial intellectual property, and academic archaeology generates books and papers that are mainly owned by commercial publishers. Access to all of these is restrictive and involves intensive surveillance (representing a threat to privacy and academic freedom). Withholding evidence for "limited and reasonable time" gets abused if there are so few positive incentives to motivate comprehensive data sharing.

The SAA needs do more than pay lip-service to the intellectual property issue. Archaeologists still have too many incentives to withhold and cherry-pick data. Perverse incentives to withhold evidence lead to many of the same negative externalities that make the antiquities trade so harmful. Bad "publish or perish" incentives lead to the loss of primary evidence and destruction of context because too many archaeologists lack the motivation to adequately share and archive their primary data.

Some of the research may be prohibited due to tribal concerns in general and not specifically. A person who did the research should be able to edit or have access to their own research. Why? Sometimes they make statements that are later proven false or that they would like to change to reflect that. For instance a survey may show no sites in doing all kinds of literature and aerial photo research and then a new technology comes along (like Lidar), and when you look at those same areas there are all kinds of sites that can be seen. I know that from personal experience. Its also now a great tool to check a contractors work. We had a contractor who should have found a large logging camp through both pedestrian and shovel test survey and it was not found. But Lidar found it. And it showed us how bad our contractor is. </td> </tr>

I think experience shows that in fact that far greater danger comes from the public NOT knowing where they are, because when the public is in the dark there is no push for protection in the face of development. I also think we need to re-evaluate the assumption that government agencies actually care about preservation.

Does all this hoarding and hiding of data from bad actors actually work? Are the negative consequences of it worse than the consequences or just releasing it all? No-one knows the answer to any of these questions, so the default position is just to lock everything down. This needs to change.

The records are extremely important in establishing the existence of highly organized heterarchical societies before colonization, a finding that would very much benefit the descendants of those societies who are dealing with inaccurate and possibly disingenuous information from some groups of western researchers.

Some universities offer funds to publish open access - maybe its worth calling for this to become more widespread and better funded? On the other hand, there are a number of complexities here - I know I certainly don't have the knowledge to create a public database of my materials.

However, not all information is appropriate for open access. Again, my expertise is in Indigenous contexts, where some information is not appropriate for certain outsiders or social groups.
