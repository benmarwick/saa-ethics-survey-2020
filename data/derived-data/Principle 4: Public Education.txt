"Principle 4: Public Education"
NA
NA
NA
"I mean sure, but this is so unwieldy that it gets lost. Everything about people is essentially crammed into this Principle. Education and Outreach are separate and conflation of the two undermines and confuses both."
NA
"I feel that we should hard-wire our commitment to collaboration, but that we also need to have some language in here about how unmitigated \"public outreach\" is not in and of itself the goal. Public archaeology shouldn't be \"public relations archaeology,\" and if you are working with sensitive materials that collaborators don't want broadcasted across the universe, then you need to work closely together to determine a communication plan."
NA
NA
"Similar to my previous answer, I am extremely wary of any ethical principles that assert archaeologists' \"expertise\" as somehow more valuable or superior to the expertise of descendent communities and laypeople engaged in archaeological preservation and work at many different levels. Public outreach is important, but our positioning must become one more of lateral relationship-building rather than top-down explanations emanating from \"expert\" archaeologists to \"inexpert\" publics."
NA
NA
"Often preached, much less often practiced."
"Most of my colleagues don't want to be bothered to engage in public outreach - even the state archaeologists who get paid whether they are productive or not, do little if any public engagement."
NA
NA

NA
NA
NA
NA
"Does not make Native Americans the primary focus and it should"
NA
NA
NA
NA
"This only talks about the past for the public for the sake of the past. We have a duty to do outreach as stewards of the present and caretakers for the future.
This should include an activist stance against the rampant bigotry and racism that is now becoming more and more accepted in the United States and others parts of the world.
Furthermore, and more importantly, archaeologists should speak out clearly about what the past tells us about the dangers of climate change."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I think this needs to be strengthened to ensure that all archaeologists can communicate with media and the public, which includes writing and video skills."
NA
"We should be more clear about how this needs to be multi-directional. Currently it seems all about communicating the value of archaeology outward, but we need multi-directional engagement to help shape archaeological priorities."
"We have been focused on \"the public\" far too long.  History and culture does not belong to everyone, and its not ours to give to everyone.  Further, as one who was involved with a volunteer stewardship program as a volunteer coordinator, my feelings about volunteers has changed over the years.  To be an archaeologist requires a degree, when we choose to give archaeological work to volunteers over paying young, new archaeologists, we devalue our profession.  Further, in my experience, most volunteers are older and white and can afford to dabble (play) at being archaeologist.  There is an elitism to it that I think we need to be more considerate of.  

We need to reexamine our relationship with the \"public\" so that we are being considerate of young professionals, of descendant communities, of ownership of the past and past materials, and of opportunity."
NA
NA
NA
NA

"We must encourage new ways to connect the value of cultural heritage with the public. We need more interpretive exhibits, monuments, digital applications available to and observable by laymen and laywomen in their daily lives."

"This needs to be more proactive, e.g. note that our goal is to counter anti-science bias"
"hmmm.  You've seemed to missed a large group: developers.  Outreach and education to these folks will increase credible work, promote understanding, and help when there are challenges to laws.
Also, I might point to the outreach needed to elected individuals; remind them of the business impact (e.g., CRM, cultural tourism, increased home values)."
NA
NA
NA
"Native Americans are not one of archaeology's \"publics\"! Time for SAA to get real about relations with the original creators and owners of the \"record\" we use in our jobs and careers."
NA
NA
NA
"We need a statement that distinguishes professional archeologies from pseudo- or mass produced theories of otherworldly influences on the past. Currently, the public learns more about Ancient Aliens than the actual indigenous histories of the Americas. The SAA needs to mobilize its members to counter these mass produced narratives about the past."

"We absolutely suck at this. We allow the Discovery and History channels to misinform the public about archaeology and support organizations within our own ranks who use Native American heritage sites to teach the general public about the importance of archaeology. ThereÂ’s 500 years of settler archaeology out there too."
NA
"I believe outreach to collectors could also be added, as far as encouraging non-destructive non-professional enjoyment of archaeological resources"
NA

NA

NA
NA
"I think this is less honored in the profession than it should be."
NA
NA
"The last line is the best part. Not everyone is capable or, if willing, is able (for a variety of reasons) to engage in these practices. The growing number of public archaeologists should be enlisted, hired, supported, and otherwise turned to as professionals."
"Archaeologists can and should also advocate for the voices of descendant communities in interpreting and stewarding the archaeological record."
"Ethics principles should primarily be what a professional should NOT do.  This is too proactive and subjective."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA

"Community engaged archaeology should be a bigger part of this"
NA
NA
"Should avocational archaeologists be specifically mentioned?"
"My concern about this statement is not that I disagree or don't think it's important. Rather, I feel that this statement should underlie other statements (such as the 1st and 3rd). I'm honestly not sure if separating it here gives it more or less impact as a statement of best practices/ethics."
"Last sentence somewhat undermines the entire principle -- archaeos who are unable to undertake public education should therefore not be practicing archaeology."
NA
"Many groupings with different views."
NA
NA
NA
"While I agree whole-heartedly with this statement, I, personally, would like to see a stronger opening: Public outreach and education is the responsibility of every professional archaeologist."
"Not always.  Archaeological sites are often on private property, or in locations not accessible to the pubic.  t"

"Native Americans, religious, and cultural groups, especially descendant groups are not individual or collective \"publics\" who should be on the receiving end of one-way communication from the archaeological community. They are partners who must be given a voice in framing education.

I do agree that not all archaeologists should be involved in public education and would in fact advocate that archaeologists who do not have specific training or a specific in public education should refrain from all but the most limited activities and that archaeologists wanting to do public education should include funds to include public education specialists."
NA
"I value this, but rarely have time and energy to invest in it. It is an ideal, but not realistic under current working conditions."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I think it is important to highlight that there might not be one \"correct\" interpretation of the past. Adding something about collaboration would improve this."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Again, I object to putting the public and descendant communities into the same box.  The requirements are very different.  One is a good idea, the other is a requirement.  By making them equivalent, this suggests they are both optional.
Also, public education is not my highest priority.  It belongs somewhere, but in the ethics section?  Consultation is an ethical imperative, but public education is just a good idea."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"If archaeologists do not act as advocates for the resource who will?  This is the place where commercial archaeology totally fails in assertng their primary obligation is to the \"client\"."
"Need to add, under many publics, collectors and avocational/amateur archaeologists"
NA
NA
"These ethics are very much focused on the US and English speaking stakeholders. I do wonder what percentage of the SAA membership works in countries that don't speak English. I think that we have an ethical duty to translate our site reports and other knowledge production into the local language to facilitate public education and dissemination of archaeological knowledge."
NA

"descendant communities, Indigenous communities, marginalized communities."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Last sentence should be removed. It gives an out for people who don't want to do outreach."
"The last line of this one has always been lame.   Really?  Every archaeologist should be working towards this goal;  we need to figure out how to use CRM laws to better the interests of much larger publics.   The \"Public\" pays the way for all we do.   We know all the benefits that come from public engagement.   We simply cannot keep operating as we do, with a relatively small sub-set of the profession pushing on public engagement, while the \"real archaeology\" happens in a research context of discovery, etc.     
If going to keep something like the last line-- should unpack/elaborate --- \"encourage and support\""
NA
NA
"Public archaeology forums and outreach should be the norm for all archaeologist to advocate and participate within."
NA
NA
NA
"Rather than just promoting that we xplain and promote the use of archaeological methods and techniques in understanding human behavior and culture, we need to also be cognizant that descendant groups might hold very different views of their history and the methods to study it"
NA
"Responsibilities to Native American and other indigenous and descendent communities should be given more emphasis and highlighted in a separate principle.  Not lumped in with other publics."
NA
NA
"I see many superficial fluff summaries of ancient lifeways, there is much more to archaeology than what we are getting.  Principle 4 offers a lofty view, but academic programs in particular do very little to provide real support (money, advancement, money, publications, money, long-term research grant programs that produce these lofty statements)."
"I agree based on the last sentence."
NA
NA
"Again who died and made us king/queen."
NA
NA
NA
"Totally ignores the avocational groups that do most of the public outreach to further preservation and protection"
NA
"Yup indeed. But the term \"public archaeology\" still has a slightly negative feel. People who are \"public archaeologists\" are not \"research archaeologists\" and the fact that I have nurtured a local museum for the last 20 years in Cambodia (grant-seeking, exhibits development, etc.) has not netted me ANY credit ANYWHERE.

I'm not complaining: I am actually quite satisfied with my career. But the fact that I've gotten no credit explains why so few of my junior colleagues do not consider doing such work.

An ethical professional archaeology expects all practitioners to do this work as part of their job, and rewards them for it."
"I just don't think there is anyone these days who can argue that they are unable to undertake public education."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"If archaeology is not a public good it will become irrelevant."
NA
"While it is important to get archaeological information out to the public, archaeologists need to be respectful of the \"affected groups\" that are mentioned a few principles ago.  Some tribes consider many archaeological objects and traditional knowledge to be confidential information that should not be shared with the public."
NA
NA
NA
"I would delete the last sentence."
NA
"See my previous comments. Despite claims about creating more public archaeolgy this is not happening because results are not readily available. The students & faculty have access to e-journals, e-dissertations, e-books & other e resources while the public does not. Even American Antiquity is not an open access journal. This needs to change. Publiclly funded research should be publically available to all!"
NA
NA
"In general I agree with this statement, though I would like to see #1 revised to clarify that archaeologists are not sole stewards of the past, but should engage in stewardship as partners with Indigenous communities who agree to this relationship."
NA
NA
"It is critically important to discuss, present, interpret our work to the various constituencies mentioned. Too often archaeologists have let others outside the discipline do this, leading to misleading or incorrect presentation of material. Such outreach should be valued more by departments in the evaluation of faculty."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I prefer the term conservation over preservation. Preservation in many cases is not possible/practical, but the resource should be conserved/maintained to the extent possible. Examples include repatriated grave goods and materials on highly erosive terrain."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I am lucky to live in a state that has an active professional/avocational relationship, but I would like more involvement, especially the academics in the state.  What is also lacking is the publication of general texts that share archeological finds and interpretations."
NA

NA
NA
"I think that there are many archaeologists in this country who are doing this and even more who promote it."
"whilst understandable from a US perspective, the sentence \"Native Americans and other\" could easily be replaced by \"any...\""
"This principle, like most of the others, should explicitly state the need for archaeologists to recognize that they must mediate among the sometimes-conflicting needs of all the publics listed and others. 

In addition, we need to add \"legally compliant private artifact collectors\" to the list of publics enshrined in this principle. By not adding it, SAA enables archaeologists who adversely impact the archaeological record by refusing to engage in the very public education that could stop the collecting we would prefer did not happen in the first place."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Its hard for me to envision someone who couldn't participate in public education and outreach at some level.  Not sure the caveat at the end is needed."
NA
"Would be nice to have more emphasis on collaboration of knowledge production instead of communication of archaeologists derived knowledge"
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"recognizing descendant communities as having an equal stake to other publics listed in the principle is deeply problematic."
NA
"This is too archaeologist-centric. We have to engage the public in ways that are meaningful to them, not just set up on our terms."
"The \"all publics are equal\" tone feels dated given current practice in U.S. and elsewhere."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Leftist publics are censoring science, in a manner quite antithetical to science itself."
"While I strongly agree, the language of the principle is quite dated. This can be updated with crisp prose"
NA
"This is a bit beside the point but I feel that the SAA should advocate public outreach for academic archaeologists. There are many non-profits and other organizations that do a lot of good outreach and public education but many academic archaeologists get little to no credit for outreach work that they do (and it's sometimes even discouraged when on the tenure track). If the SAA could make a strong statement that it was part of the obligation of all archaeologists to make efforts toward public outreach, this might help sway some universities to value such activities more."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"This point might be strengthened by adding that local communities should be consulted prior to commencement of excavation and involved in the work to the extent possible (e.g., as paid workers, volunteers, participants in field trips, etc.)."
"This goal needs to account for differences in social, political, and economic power. Not all stakeholders are equal. For example, it should be made clear that archaeologists need not assist white supremacists in promoting racist ideologies. Furthermore, archaeologists should include consultation with various publics in the design of research, too. Engaging with the public should involve determining how our research design or research outcomes (e.g., aDNA studies) could be misappropriated by stakeholders with marginalizing intents. SAA should position itself to compel archaeologists to develop foresight (as possible) for how our research is misused to do harm,"
NA
"I promote and live the dissemination of archaeological information to diverse publics. Careful as to not disclose sensitive locational or other information.  I have executed Tribal consultation as early as 1983, prior to it being \"required\"."
"It sounds very self-serving to say that archaeologists should reach out to interested communities in order to preserve and protect the archaeological record. Maybe the public engagement would be better off serving community well-being (today). In addition, archaeologists may be able to learn from members of the public in such a way that archaeologists can learn about and not just communicate archaeological interpretations of the past through engagement."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"How are there any \"Archaeologists who are unable to undertake public education and outreach directly\"?"
"ItÂ’s worth noting though that as absolutely critical as this is we have done nothing to change the Â“incentiveÂ” structure of the profession; - to use the common broad breakdown of CRM/GOV/academic - CRM firms and government agencies are never held to account for public outreach and academic archaeologists can not use public outreach efforts as tangible evidence of their work in the field for promotion/tenure. Our funding agencies give lip service to this in the form of asking for things like Â“broader impactÂ” statements w/o requiring actual attempts to have a broader impact (in the form of public talks, outreach projects, etc). What funding we do have is vastly geared to the research/excavation and rarely is there funding for public outreach."
"Should is not strong word
Way too many words 
As started it always puts archaeologists in the role of the authority instead of as the listener and learner"
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I agree with almost all aspects of this principle. However, I believe that our relationship to indigenous and descendant peoples needs to have its own principle. Native Americans are not just the \"public,\" they are sovereign nations with whom we have a unique relationship."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"we should not restrict ourselves to promoting understanding through archaeological methods. It is important to engage communities through lenses relevant to them. (Also we could learn something ourselves)."
NA
"Please see previous response. The quality and quantity of public education and outreach are simply inadequate to preserve the archaeological record to the extent it should be preserved. There is insufficient public and political support for archaeology since most archaeologists are not stepping to the plate and engaging in public ed and outreach efforts. A few are working very hard at this but barely making a dent since they do not have the entire SAA membership engaging in such efforts."
NA
"See previous answers"
NA
"Again, lots of specifics here. I like this one (although the phrase \"many publics\" is awkward)."
"Change Native Americans to Indigenous groups, I work in the old world."
NA
NA
NA
"Way too long, should just be - Archaeologists should reach out to others interested archaeology. It's a principal of ethics, not a paragraph of ethics."

"#2 could be worded better to explain that \"archaeological methods\" must be used in conjunction with supervision by professionals. We don't want non-professionals using scientific methods to loot \"better\"."

"Different types of archaeologists engage in the discipline & practice for different, but still ethical, reasons. Not everyone can or Should engage in public archaeology."
NA
NA
"Again not very clearly written. \"Reach out\" for example is business jargon that may be confusing for speakers of other varieties of English, speakers of English as a second language, etc. How should we \"enlist\", \"promote\", and \"communicate\", in concrete terms?"
NA
"Perhaps could be improved by framing COLLABORATION as a primary goal."
NA
NA
NA
"Again, could be reframed so that knowledge flows BETWEEN archaeologists and the public, stakeholders, etc. are acknowledged. The emphasis should be on collaboration, not just archaeologists handing out \"their\" knowledge."
NA
NA
NA
"It's a little paternalistic still. Could incorporate more a goal of collaboration with descendent communities rather than just \"educating them\"."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"There needs to be a two way conversation. Stewardship can be about listening to."
NA
"I'm somewhat hesitant about \"encourage and support the efforts of others\" since some of those efforts are clearly contrary to facts/evidence.  Perhaps this should be qualified in some way re: legitimate efforts, efforts in line with other ethical principles."
"We should also advocate for the Native people and descent groups whose ancestors we research, when possible and in keeping with their wishes"
"This principle should be called Public education and community engagement rather than outreach, as outreach denotes a unidirectional hierarchical relationship. Ethical principles should encourage archaeologists to also learn from the communities and integrate their knowledge into the research. While we can teach about archaeology, we can also certainly do a better job learning the worldviews of those connected to the pasts we are researching. These relationships should be balanced, representing 'braided knowledge' rather than hierarchical knowledge with archaeologists on top."
"It should be a requirement of any project. This shoild have been part of NHPA."
NA
NA
NA
"This is incredibly relevant as an ethical principle and I feel that this is public education and outreach that should be more emphasized (and recognized by institutions) in archaeological practice."
NA
"Not every project is for the public"
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Framing \"Native Americans\" (a term which I think should be broadened, since not all members are Americans) as another \"stakeholder\" group is problematic. There are different relationships between Native Americans and their pasts (which make up the bulk of archaeological work done in North America) and other \"interest groups\"."
NA
NA
"This is certainly a large part of my job, and something that I am evaluated on yearly. We must be able to teach the general public about the importance of archaeology in order for the profession to continue. We cannot lose our cultural heritage."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Public support is one of the most important factors in successful research. I also think publics can be helpful in monitoring the protection of sites and informally monitoring states of erosion or damage due to looting and development."
NA
NA
NA
"This is still a very germane principle. I might update it to move beyond the 1990s version of public archaeology, which was relatively top-down and didactic. I'd revise this one to make it more in line with a deeper collaborative ethic that looks to share authority and perspectives with multiple stakeholders."
"I agree, but think that the ethics should take into account that knowledge building around archaeology may not need to be some one directional: from archaeologist to other people. Especially when speaking to indigenous communities or local communities in the case of historic period archaeology interpretations of the past may not be solely from archaeologist to others, we should encourage archaeologists to hear as well as speak in outreach situations."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"This needs to be reframed to include language regarding our past dismissal of interacting with Native Americans and other groups that are disenfranchised."

"If the public is not convinced of the value of knowledge derived through archaeology, then cultural resource preservation (law and regulation) will disappear. Stewardship is the usual focus of SAA (and academic) educational programming, and I would not diminish that. However, there is a far more fertile message moving into the future, which would be the use of examples from past human history to increase understanding of basic principles of human ecology: climate change, demography, economy, social structure. Our education program also has a dimension which has been increasing embraced by descendant communities where instead of telling them their own histories, we provide access to technologies that can have an important role in modern cultural practice but that were lost during the formal government and education policies of acculturation to Euroamerican values. Also, we find that the archaeological community in a corporate sense feels no responsibility to support educational programming unless they see a narrowly defined corporate benefit. In my organization, we have the advantage of developing long term (30+ year) relationships with descendant communities and individuals, and that seems to be non-existent in for-profit contract archaeology."

"Again, I work in a community for the last 12 years on a long-term archaeological project and we involve community members in all ways - working in the field with us, individual families in rural areas in this community have always been involved in our work at archaeological sites. Our advocate, the local mayor, has developed our project as an example of scientific research on heritage, and we have promoted college age team members to focus on archaeology or museum work as a profession."

"I think way more needs to be done in promoting this idea.

NA
NA
NA
NA
"This is an important principle, but it has a few gaps.

Other \"publics\" that need education and outreach are developers, private land owners, and granting organizations. Granting organizations, in particular, don't seem to value the responsibilities and activities associated with taking care of and accessing/researching/interpreting collections as much as sites. Both are part of the archaeological record and both need support.

"
NA
"We should include as part of our statement the recognition that soldiers are a special class of the public that need to be educated, and potentially the SAA should create a special committee to work with the military. 

Archaeological projects -- whether they are using undergraduates or using public volunteers -- can be equality rigorous.  If Â“public educationÂ” programs are thought of and ran like a good field school, then there need not be a difference between the Â“rigorÂ” of projects.  It is probably more an issue of attitude on the part of archaeologists and academics then an actual difference in project quality. 

Can public outreach projects be certified through RPA like field schools can be? Would that be an approach to creating a sense of Â“rigorÂ”?"

"I am a huge advocate for public archaeology and wholeheartedly believe archaeologists should engage in it more often. BUT I don't think it should be required, as described above. Some archaeologists are terrible public communicators and can cause more harm than good, for both communities and archaeology. Also, we need to recognize that there is a very colonial history to public archaeology (i.e. sites being opened to tourists during the early ages of archaeology in North America) and in some cases public archaeology is inappropriate.

"I think this principle captures the expansive range of responsibilities archaeologists have to non-archaeological stakeholders, but would be better formulated if it recognized that some communities have special standing with respect to the heritage value of archaeological sites and materials; journalists, reporters, the general public are not (necessarily) on the same footing as members of an Indigenous community who count archaeological material as part of their cultural heritage."

"Public education as outlined above can be harmful to resources and communities - public awareness and Â“supportÂ” is inappropriate and leads to destruction of resources, and the content related to both methodology and interpretation of a resource should be led by Tribal communities, with the understanding that some things are not meant for public knowledge from the Tribes perspective."
"Public education is not the primary function of the archaeological profession, and what does occur is usually focused on the majority community, rarely acknowledging the relationship of American archaeology to native communities. Archaeologists excavate ancestral Tribal villages and sites, yet  they usually don't make the effort to include Tribal peoples in studies. Archaeologists continue to want to study Indian stuff, without input or interference from actual Indians."
NA
"Archaeologists in public education settings often overreach and present themselves as experts in other peoples' history.  They often misinterpret, mischaracterize, and sensationalize aspects of living peoples' culture in ways that are disrespectful and harmful.  Archaeologists must better own the destruction and disenfranchisement that their own professional fieldwork and curation protocols create."
"I believe iÂ’ve seen more archaeological outreach, that had invited other archaeologists or arch students rather than an open public. Even then, at the National Parks or federally managed landsÂ— the Â“archaeological educationÂ” lacks tribal history because it does not parallel archaeological science data/theory/timeline.

It is true that there are many publics, and that content should be tailored to the needs of those publics, but it would be good to include mention that the primary beneficiaries of community/public engagement should be the local community most closely associated with archaeologists' locus of research. \"Outreach\" sounds very one-directional, disengaged way of communicating information to communities. Archaeologists should be encouraged to learn from communities with an open mind,   and integrate their knowledge into the research. This does not mean that they should compromise their own scientifically-based knowledge... only the need to include traditional perspectives as an additional point of view on the subject. Better yet if they can look beyond literal interpretation of myths, etc. to see the wisdom of their perspective and incorporate those into their narrative and practice."

Often archaeological interpretations can be upsetting to descendant groups, and can encourage forms of oppression (e.g. \"this culture was violent\" can encourage or justify oppression because a government could claim they are protecting the people from a violent culture. So when other interpretations become available to help descendant groups make sense of their past, it is important that emerging archaeologists can publish those data and educate about new interpretations without fearing that their career will be ruined by older archaeologists who they are contradicting."

If the statement on ethics were to say outright that this is a kind of dissemination that should be privileged because it contributes to the furtherance of our priorities I think it might discourage the dismissal of popularizers."

"This is an extremely important principle to me. However, the framing favors a unilateral model of outreach as opposed to collaboration, in which archaeologists communicate expert knowledge to a lay public. A truly cooperative effort would go beyond this. I think that any archaeologist who works with descendant peoples will tell you, we learn far more rich and powerful information from community members than we can ever really reciprocate. Particularly important to consider here are how archaeologists should engage with multiple ways of knowing, including oral traditions. 

Likewise, should archaeologists seek to enlist the support of Indigenous publics (for example) for the stewardship of the archaeological record, or should non-native archaeologists learn from Indigenous caretaking practices?"

Many publics exist for archaeology including students and teachers; Native Americans and other ethnic, religious, and cultural groups who find in the archaeological record important aspects of their cultural heritage; lawmakers and government officials; reporters, journalists, and others involved in the media; and the general public. 

This text is not clear.

We have encountered situations where at least one academic archaeologist paid private collectors to collect paleo Indian projectile points and other artifacts from federal lands.  Not only did he not have a permit to work on federal lands, but he also committed innumerable ARPA violations.  Through a plea agreement, only the collectors themselves were subjected to prosecution for this crime.  The academic himself received NO punishment.  There was no mechanism through either the SAA or ROPA to hold him accountable.  

Archaeologists need to be aware that their research activities are regulated on state and federal lands and internationally.  To date, the scope of federal and state regulations often appears to be unacknowledged or unknown, especially by academic archaeologists."

Some descendant communities may not want archaeological data and interpretations to be made public, or may offer alternative interpretations.

"This is a highly problematic sentence:  \"Many publics exist for archaeology including students and teachers; Native Americans and other ethnic, religious, and cultural groups who find in the archaeological record important aspects of their cultural heritage; lawmakers and government officials; reporters, journalists, and others involved in the media; and the general public.\" 

Archaeologists should not be \"telling\" a Native community their history.  They should be partnering with descendant communities to creative collaborative, community-based projects that benefit the community, not just the academic's career or a federal or state agency's project timeline.  

Public outreach should be an even more integral part of archaeology.  Why does it matter? Who are we helping?"
"If we don't, who will?"

"Currently archaeological information is not well-integrated or used in the global response to climate change. While more analysis of the reasons for this are needed, part of the reason (from personal research in the issue) appears to be that archaeologists have ended their analyses at the point of archaeological understanding and NOT ensured that links are available from their research to climate issues facing society. They have left it to others to make the connections, which has resulted in archaeology being left out of most major climate assessments of the past 30 years. While this may feel scientifically safe, it has created a context in which archaeological sites and the information and connections they hold are not valued by the world at large, and by extension both sites and information are at greater risk of destruction by climate impacts and the global climate response lacks human time depth. Archaeologists must have responsibility to engage in major modern social issues."

"Native Americans are not one of many publics in American archaeology. Referring to the descendants of the people whose material culture you study as a Â“publicÂ” on par with other publics is insulting and reflects the SAAÂ’s continued marginalization of Indigenous people in archaeology."

"Again, I'd like to see this a part of expectations for tenure and promotion, because otherwise, university professors won't engage.  Companies also should devote some %age of their profits into public outreach."

"\"Archaeologists who are unable to undertake public education and outreach directly should encourage and support the efforts of others in these activities.\" This let's people off the hook too easily!"
