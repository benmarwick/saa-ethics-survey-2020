"Unfortunately, as Title IX guidance has changed in ways that now seem to no longer follow students or faculty into field settings (according to one Title IX investigator I spoke with) this Principle needs to be re-evaluated more substantially, esp. in light of the recent changes to bylaws as a result of SAA 2019. 

Also, let's note that even with Principle SAA 2019 still happened the way it did, not only with Yesner, but continued racial discrimination - also- why is race missing from this list? In the US, race functions very specifically in ways that are different from ethnicity, I never noticed that before. Also, veteran status is protected class, so perhaps an etc. should be added - both for US-based and international reasons."

"This does not go far enough, and seems to especially target students and trainees when almost EVERYONE in this field is vulnerable to harassment. It puts the onus on \"following laws\" rather than archaeologists being responsible for actively creating and promoting safe workplaces. This should list out the aspects of safe workplaces that archaeologists everywhere commit to rather than relying on \"local laws\" to fill in for our professional ethics."
"Compliance with the law is not sufficient for fostering a supportive and safe environment. A focus on what is required by law may even undermine such an environment."

"Every employer should comply with OSHA standards. Too often, however, I have found students unwilling to commit themselves to the sacrifices that archaeology has historically required. Too often they want immediate gratification, a \"position\" rather than a \"job,\" and immediate responsibility when they have never done any REAL archaeology."
"This is absolutely critical if we are to grow as a profession."
"I feel like this language should be stronger. with recent issues regarding sexual harassment and racism in our community we can't have such a passive statement regarding one of the most harmful things that happens within our society. We need to take a stronger stand against harassers and protect all of our members that are minorities. we need to protect and enhance those voices within the academic space in order to foster true change"

Suggested wording:
Principle 9: Safe Educational and Workplace Environments
Archaeologists in all work, educational, and other professional settings, including fieldwork and conferences, are responsible for fostering a supportive and safe environment for colleagues, crews, students, trainees, and visitors."
"There needs to be more regulatory oversight to hold lead archaeologists accountable if they violate these laws, especially where they may be in grey areas such as university settings."

"Add to this labor, and financial conditions, because precarious conditions (adjunct faculty, short term contracts) make people more vulnerable to abuse. 

Labor conditions should not undermine or threaten access to healthcare, time commitments needed for a healthy emotional and family life, etc.

"The problem with this statement is in practice.  How much do archaeologists get paid?  What kind of job security do archaeologists have?  How many women archaeologists (especially outside of academia) get to have children and keep their job?  The institution of archaeology is NOT sufficiently supportive of its practitioners."
"there are members who do not abide by this principle and create a toxic work environment either on university campuses or fieldwork. There has to be better ways to hear complaints, collect reports, and take actions against this situation."
"Please also mention age discrimination. Many people often engage in archaeology when they are older. In particular, older women ie over 40 years old, who engage in archaeology are often mistreated, ignored, excluded and not taken seriously.  This also happens to men, but not to the same extent.  It is unfortunate that the field of archaeology does not adequately allow for the inclusion of older people who are often highly experienced in fields outside of archaeology."

"We should aim to always expand upon our understanding and interpretation of laws, and provide a variety of resources to those of us less-informed than others.

"This principle still reads like an afterthought. While I think its intent is important, the fact that the SAA board will not take up all the recommendations of the Task Force on Sexual and Anti-Harassment Policies and Procedures underscores how empty all of these principles are...just discourse and no praxis."
"Unfortunately, I don't think we can just rely on laws. Many people face harassment without any laws being broken. I think there might be a better choice of words."
"While I strongly agree, in practice this has sometimes led to ridiculous charges.  With that being said, fieldwork is an easy place for predators to search for prey, as is both the office and educational institutions with power relationships."
"Should go without saying."
"I feel that this aspect of ethics should already be present for archeologists via their institutions - schools, agencies, employers. Its a sad state we're in if there is a whole cadre of archeologists who don't get exposure to this ethical principle via other means than their professional association!   Ultimately, though, it should remain in our code because it is so fundamental and important to humanity."

knowing laws and obaying laws is not sufficient - we can hold ourselves to a higher standard and make a clear statement that mistreatment of other archaeologists or others involved in archaeological projects is not acceptable."

ALSO - gender inequity is a thing in our discipline!!  Opportunities, pay, and mentoring practices break along gendered lines.  Can we address this please?  I think gender inequities need their own, separate principle.  Something like, \"Archaeologists will work to create active awareness of the structural inequities that exist in our disicipline and in the wider society with respect to gender, race, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.  In their professional activities and hiring practices, archaeologists will actively work to ameliorate, redress, and counter these inequalities....\""

"Understanding the law on sexual harassment is a good place to start, but we must also be aware of ethical constraints- i.e. actions that might not technically be illegal but not ethical ways to behave. Also, there should be some provision in these guidelines to delineate what our responsibilities are when we become aware of misconduct. Our inability to self-police over the past decades has led to the abundance of field misconduct stories in the press currently plaguing our membership (I can think of 4 Balter pieces recently). There needs to be a process for reporting that keeps vulnerable, early-career researchers safe."

I feel like misbehavior in the field, sometimes in remote locations overseas, should be a primary concern of our code of ethics.

We need to recognize that these closed societies are distinctively problematic and do what we can to normalize behavior for all within them."

"but one might also want to add something about power differentials and that even if your institution has no rules, as a professional we need to abide by a set of professional standards RPA or other.

"Whose \"home nation\"? How does one handle situations where a student or trainee initiates the harassment or assault? While this is rarer than assault by supervisors because of the power balance, it can occur. Also, how does one handle what one might call \"lateral\" harassment, when a colleague of comparable rank or career stage initiates harassment? Is there space for consensual relationships, or are these always corrupt because the higher ranked person will tend to favor his or her lover over others of similar rank. I personally have felt harassed in such a situation. That is, because I did not get involved sexually with a supervisor, I was disfavored over people who did, even though I had good reason to believe that those who did were in consensual relationships."
"While I think it is useful to mention the laws and policies of the home nation, I would like to see a stronger statement about the inherent ethical responsibility to create a safe and welcoming environment for all."

"Nothing wrong with this, but saying archaeologists should follow the law is unnecessary in what are effectively HR issues. Why is this limited specifically to \"training the next generation of archaeologists\"?

What code of ethics says to violate the law? Why is a code saying \"obey the law\" useful?"

"The way this is worded, anyone who doesn't \"strongly agree\" is apparently in favor of \"unsafe spaces.\"  Who are the harassers and perpetrators of \"assault\" these days?  Anyone who has the finger of a socially sanctioned \"victim\" with permanent immunity pointed at them - guilty with no chance of demonstrating innocence.  And when the scam fails, they run around claiming that a \"rapist\" has been given a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.  Who are the victims of these so-called \"hate crimes\"; why anyone who claims to be one.  An obvious attempt to purge the membership of undesirable white, heterosexual males.

Activities that could easily be seen as harassing in a US context may be seen quite differently in other cultural settings. We need to insure the safety of all parties but should approach the situation with appropriate  cross-cultural sensitivity."

I have seen many more unsafe field and lab situations because of equipment, conditions, tools, weather, lack of training, and fooling around by fieldworkers than I have seen sexual harassment situations (and I am a woman who has been hit on by male archaeologists for 30 years!)."
"I am glad this principle was added. However, the focus on laws and policies has always seemed problematic. Ethics are different from laws and policies. Laws and policies may be unethical or, at least, insufficient. The SAA should be committed to working against all harassment and discrimination, regardless of various nations' laws or universities' policies."

"The language here should be less focused on laws and policies and more focused on universal values of respect. In my experience, a major issue leading to harm in fieldwork settings is differential understanding of what \"safe and respectful learning environments\" look like. It is the prerogative of a professional organization like the SAA to establish a definition to which it holds its members, regardless of local conditions."

"The sexual harassment situation is a lot better now than when I was a student (and we warned each other when groper archaeologists were in the vicinity), but it still happens. And we don't effective ways of dealing with it. As one example, a female graduate student in our program accompanied a colleague to China for fieldwork. One night there, they both drank too much and he propositioned her (he *did* ask; he didn't force) and she said no. It made her so uncomfortable that she talked with a few of us about it, but -- short of her lodging an official complaint against him -- we were, I was told, unable to help her. She dropped out of the program. This shouldn't happen.


Neither should both male and female professional archaeologists violate these ethics, if having sex with undergraduate and graduate students is included as a no-no.  I know about cases from the students who slept with them: and sadly this includes two female professors and their undergraduate male students.  This shouldn't happen, and there should be penalties.

"So, I have some real problems with this part. Before 2016, I thought this was about physical safety because I had seen so many team leaders ignore good practice about weather, water, safe working with tools, adequate food and housing, reasonable ladders, accommodating the smaller bodies of women archaeologists when providing equipment, being willing to abide by OSHA guidelines for standing walls in excavations, vehicle safety, parasitic diseases transmitted or exacerbated by excavation. etc. That kind of stuff, that is intrinsic to doing archaeology, and the things that have killed archaeologists over the generations. 
Now, it seems like \"safety\" is a code word for avoiding sexual violence and racism. Aspects of sexual violence protections are protected by law, as are racial hate crimes. Universities have broad mandates to enforce Title IX even away from the U.S. as a matter of protecting students involved in educational activities. I have thought a lot about this and feel like treating this as sexual violence only means that it ignores power differentials of several types that are intrinsic to education, to scientific research, and to work life generally. When a person is harassed or assaulted in the field or in a hotel by someone strong enough to overcome them, or armed, perhaps, it's bad but not all this behavior is illegal. When this is supervisor-worker setting, or a mentor-student setting, etc. it is a violation of other ethical standards involving the abuse of institutional or economic power and a crime. I know that this abuse was a root cause of the exclusion of women from the field for decades. Now that women dominate numerically in the field, I see that abusing economic or institutional power without necessarily involving sexual violence may be an even more profound issue, and one that I resist being labeled under \"safety\".

This principle is more generic, and essentially states that archaeologists should follow general public laws (in this case, focused on disability or discrimination). These laws apply to all, not just archaeologists, and no case has been made that narrows this to a single profession. As such, adding it to a general principles list is like adding one that states \"archaeologists should not murder.\" This is already a given. Also troubling is the current presence of two frameworks in the U.S., one a legal framework with due process rights and the other (TItle IX) which is extra-judicial with limited or no due process rights, application of this principle is muddied."

Also, because a lot of field work occurs on public lands (BLM, FS, NPS, BOR, BIA, State, etc.) should government agencies become partners in this?  If violations occur on public lands or under federal permits, the federal government agencies may need to be involved.  The buck ultimately stops with the government (federal, state, county, city, etc.).  The same may be true for many of the other Principles, but I'm not quite sure how."
NA
"I recognize that the problematic situations that were allowed to exist in the 1970s and 1980s may be less common nowadays, but perhaps the statement in the policy should be more specific.  It still seems to be the case that not a few researchers look at field work as a way to express yourself or find yourself romantically or sexually, and both students and local people in fieldwork situations stand in a subaltern relationship with foreign scientists, especially men but not only men.  It is still common for a researcher to form a relationship with a subaltern person that is by definition unequal.  These relationships often end with the end of the field season but even when they do not, the relationships often break up when the student of local person has difficulty adapting to life in the sphere of the researcher.  In any case, people who make these relationships often do not look at the social stratification aspect and don't consider what their effect is on the other person.  Something in the policy that acknowledges social inequality and the needd to protect \"inferiors\" from harm in unequal relationships might be good."

Framing this in terms of following laws is a bit of a disservice, I think - particularly when law enforcement is notoriously bad at enforcing these laws, particularly in communities of color. Anyway, harassment is unethical, regardless of existing laws, and \"passing the buck\" in this way is a bit of a punt in my opinion."

I think this needs to also include direct reference to the laws and policies of the location where the work is taking place

"Reasonable statement, but it has no enforcability.  As the organization has seen, predators exist in the field (in a shockingly large number) and yet, very little is done about them.  A code of ethics is great and all, but only if it is adhered to and if there are consequences for violating it.  This is where the SAA has fallen down.  It's nice for you to say these are the codes of ethics but if you can't actually make sure your members are safe, it's not worth very much.  I would also like to see specific language included about sexual harassment and assaults- specifically stating that it will not be tolerated.  Language matters and the specific problems the field is facing need to be addressed head on and speciically, not as part of some vague larger whole (although general statements on the importance of safety should also be included)"
"Archaeologists need to foster a proper environment for everyone, not just students and trainees. I find that some PI's/supervisors do not hold back on conflicts they have with other PI's/supervisors, thus allowing these conflicts to affect both other researchers/team members as well as students and trainees. Furthermore, there are actions and behavioural patterns that are not strictly forbidden by law but yet unacceptable."

"In the previous surveys by the SAA referring specifically to sexual harassment, and as addressed in numerous studies on the topic of sexual harassment and assault in academia (even if in areas other than archaeology and anthropology), it has been clear that national and workplace laws and policies have failed to promote safety to students, trainees, and professionals. With the recent changes on Title IX by the current administration, the safety of educational and workplace settings is even more hindered.The SAA can encourage professionals, departments, and professionals to establish their own policies against discrimination, sexual harassment and assault. Departments can establish more clear paths of reporting, professors in the labs and during their field programs can have conversations with their students and assistants about what to do in case of harassment/assault/discrimination. The responsibility is on archaeologists in position of power to establish a safe environment, but students and trainees can also be provided resources through the SAA on how to have conversations with their professors and supervisors to make these policies clear in their specific educational and workspace environments."

SAA can help link supervisors to effective resources."

"I think the principle absolutely belongs here, but the wishy-washy phrasing is not helpful. All the text telling us to \"follow existing laws\" sidesteps the real ethical concerns. You might just as well replace most of the earlier principles by citing the antiquities act and leaving it there. It's not enough to just say this is covered elsewhere. The ethics of personal responsibility and safe environments needs to be clearly spelled out. This principle should stand on its own as a standard to hold each of us to. When someone violates it, that should be clear from the way the principle is written. As it is now, it seems like a placeholder that shifts responsibility to the legal system. SAA needs to be able to sanction members who don't follow ethical standards separately from whether they are technically legal or not. It's probably not technically illegal to take 30 years to report on an excavation, but the ethics of those situations are clear here. This should be the same. Contributing to a work environment that causes subordinates to feel unsafe needs to be specifically prohibited, and those who do so should be held to account whether or not their actions accord with \"the laws and policies of their home nation.\" Are you saying that people from nations with poor records of civil rights are free to come here and harass people because it's fine where they are from? Of course not, that's obvious, but that kind of inconsistency and failure to clearly spell out what's ok and what's not too often results in failure to take action in situations where young women are put in impossible situations during their training without apparent recourse and threats to their ability to pursue their research."
NA
"Needs consequences. Also, knowing the laws and consequences of their home nation and institutional workplace is not enough. They do need to know this, but there should also be a statement from SAA about OUR standards. Ethical principles should require more than just following someone else's rules. It should also clearly apply to everyone, not just supervisors. It is everyone's responsibility to prevent and harassment. Terms also need to be defined by SAA, not just by other institutions. 

I think that the RPA guidelines are much better in this respect. Here they are:

\"An archaeologists responsibility is to create a safe work environment free of harassment of all types, including sexual. Sexual harassment in this Code is defined as a pattern of unwanted advances, references, or remarks of a physical or sexual nature when an individual has expressed that such advances, references, or remarks are unwelcome.
 
\"An archaeologist shall not engage in sexual, gender, and any other form of harassment or violence (including verbal, symbolic, or physical) against any colleague, student, employee, employer, sponsor, or member of the public in the conduct of archaeological practice. An archaeologist shall intervene when witnessing such behavior by others. Intervention is important as it substantiates claims made by those who are victims while reducing the likelihood of retaliation.\"

This statement does not go far enough in saying that directors are responsible for not harassing, just that they should \"be aware\" of the regulations.  It needs to be more strongly worded."

If there is to be a period of time after which the person could appeal to the ethics committee that they be reinstated in the organization, then that timeframe should be established here."

"Interesting that that this is defined as supervisors fulfilling an objective of making a safe environment for younger students and trainees. While that's no doubt a laudable goal, and of course such crimes are indeed prevalent in settings where there is a disparity in interpersonal power dynamics, is it only for the sake of the young that we should act appropriately and respectfully? What about inappropriate acts against one's older colleagues? What about between younger peers, neither of which is yet a \"responsible supervisor?\" Why specify just work or educational settings? Archaeologists are often forced into close quarters off site and after hours, be it a field house, hotels, etc.

Urging archaeologists to follow the law and be respectful seems inadequate to the problem at hand, especially in light of the recent research by Meyers identifying the prevalence of sexual harassment in our field in particular. SAA should embrace recent objective studies and research on this topic in a comprehensive policy."

Surely safe and respectful work environments also exclude harassment and assault of employees and also colleagues."
"I think it's one thing to know and abide by the local laws, and another thing to have the organization define the terms for themselves (e.g., in an organization glossary) and then explicitly prohibit discrimination, harassment, etc. based on sex, gender identity, etc. It is definitely important to know and behave within the local laws, but it is also important to be held accountable by the organization."

It needs to be specific and make a clear statement against sexual harassment, gender-based harassment (and bias), and so much more. This sort of general \"be safe\" language is so broad that it could mean everything and nothing. I honestly doubt that harassers see themselves as NOT making a safe and respectful environment. Call it out as clearly and specifically as possible."

The laws of our home nation and rules of our institution are part of this, but I think this should be more specific. We need to make it clear to students or people in relatively more marginal positions that they can and should report harassment and discrimination. Supervisors, especially in field settings, should have systems for reporting harassment and discrimination in place. These reporting systems should include explicit directions for how to report supervisors. Any participants in these projects should know how to report this before they begin work on the project."
"Given current events, there may be useful expansions of these terms to provide better guidance."

"There needs to be teeth to these rules if they are to be actually followed through. I've seen too many predators have their wrists slapped and then sent on their way."
"Certainly we all want all students, employees, and colleagues to be spared from a hostile work environment.  As a woman who came up through the ranks in archaeology decades ago when sexual harassment was commonly encountered, though, I worry a bit about the direction that this is taking today within SAA and academia.  Back then, we had to fight our own battles, stand up for ourselves, and demand respect.  There were plenty of good men who treated us appropriately and backed us up when we stood up for ourselves.  But, generally speaking, nobody was responsible for \"ensuring\" that we were treated with respect except ourselves.  Physical safety is critically important and it's everybody's job. I'm not sure that bringing up students to expect that some entity -- their university, their employer, their professional organization -- bears all the responsible for ensuring that they feel safe and protected and respected is doing them a favor.  Personal responsibility is also important.  It's good practice for life in the world, and sometimes the best approach to a hostile work environment is a little hostility of your own.  Feel free to say \"OK, Boomer\" now."
"This varies greatly. There are, unfortunately, still pockets where sexual harassment is rampant. Also, our academy is not encouraging of as diverse a population of young people as it should. Why are there so few African American, Latinx, and Native American archaeologists? Clearly, those of us in the profession are doing an inadequate job of recruiting and retaining them and makingn sure that they are comfortable in our classrooms and on our excavations."

"That first sentence misses the point, it focuses this whole principle on \"training the next generation of archaeologists\" instead of being decent people to everyone, all the time. 

\"Archaeologists value and respect human lives and bodies\" would be a better framing sentence. The explain the whys and hows of that value/respect.

This feels so wishy-washy about the actual problem: I've been sexually assaulted by archaeologists at conferences. I've been sexually harassed on the job site. I've confronted people who were engaged in sexually assaulting students while on field schools. Quite honestly, roll for \"type of inexcusable conduct\" and \"place where you'll find archaeologists\" and I can guarantee I've live it or can direct you to someone who can. Not all archaeologists are guilty of sexual misconduct and harassment, but *no* archaeologist is safe from it until *every* archaeologist loudly and constantly denounces it.

So be clear: SAA archaeologists value and respect human lives, experiences, and bodies. SAA archaeologists will not engage in behaviors or speech that devalue and disrespect human lives, experiences, and bodies. SAA archaeologists will strive to keep open and clear communication with each other on how best to foster environments that are not only safe, but thriving."
"Why does this say home nations? Shouldn't we also know the laws in the countries in which we work? I mean, if sexual assault is punishable by death in a particular country, it would behoove the field supervisor to know that since it could certainly cause issues if someone was raped at a field school and reported it to the local police. If our home country's laws are more stringent, then of course those should be followed.  I'd also like to see this section have a mandate to report assaults and harassment as mandated by local and institutional law and to hold supervisors responsible for making sure all students and trainees know the policies and laws and how to report them (point of contact, phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses) and how to get other types of assistance (e.g., medical)."

"Again, this is a nice idea. We can all think of many examples within the discipline where it is not followed in practice. What is the consequence, in the context of the SAA, for violating this principle? 

Perhaps this (and the previous 8 principles) should be amended to state that those who are aware of such activity on the part of others and tolerate it or fail to speak out, are also complicit. In my own research area, it is common knowledge which project directors commit sexual harassment, bully their graduate students, ignore student and worker safety, and so on. Some people are honest about it but others prefer to remain silent, or pretend the problem does not exist."
"I need you all to make a much strong stance on this. Layout specific consequences for those who do not follow this policy. Be explicit and say that if some one if found guilty of Title IX charges they will be expelled. If they are criminally convicted of this they will be removed from SAA. AAA has laid out a much more detailed path for action."
"Very important newer principle, but I would like to see some adjustment beyond \"home nation\" or \"institutional workplace.\" We also have certain community standards for those archaeologists might work with, including Indigenous communities, that might need careful attention. Also, the \"this includes\" language is all about very well-defined negative outcomes -- especially legal ones -- like harassment or assault, which is absolutely necessary, but some language about making the field more diverse and welcoming from a non-legal perspective could be added."

"I have known too many intelligent females who have been driven out of archaeology by misogynistic jerks. I've worked with very few blacks and hispanics, but, I suspect they face the same problems. The influx of middle class individuals into archaeology in the 60s and 70s via the GI bill was a huge boon to the field. Women have also has a significant change on the field, and including more women in the field can only be a benefit. Minorities will bring new insights into various issues that are often overlooked."

There is a large amount of violators who are never prosecuted by their universities, place of work, or by the law. Please consider creating an independent organization that will review complaints and revoke memberships of people who the organization finds to have credible violations regardless of whether they were prosecuted by their place of work or by they law."

It would be stronger to say that and then explain as this paragraph has done. That being said, this is much better than anything we have had up until this point and I commend the organization for this.

I also don't understand why racial category is not included in this list? It may not be a biological reality, but it is a social and legal reality, and has become more pertinent since this was written surely. Consider whether a different version of the concept of race or presumed race could be included here to show visible support for Black members & directly critique racial categorization (as opposed to ignoring it)."

SAA should hold all members accountable for respecting all people and treating everyone equally and with respect. SAA should not tolerate racism, sexism, or any type of bigotry from any of its members regardless of the laws of the area, and deferring to legal and institutional rules as opposed to taking a strong stance on this is cowardly."

I recommend taking that first sentence out or incorporating our responsibilities to the next generation in another principle."

SAA needs to take a stand and provide specific guidelines, best practices, and principles for the organization and default to the legal system or \"institutional\" policies, which is simply deferring responsibility 

this part of the ethics statement appears to only focus on those archaeologists who have students or trainees, rather than holding all individuals accountable for ethical behavior."

"The biggest problem with field situations (field school or contract jobs) is the culture of heavy drinking among archaeologists.  Alcohol leads to sexual harassment and assault.  I've seen it too many times.  When I've worked on projects in dry tribal communities, we don't have such problems.  I don't know how to tackle the culture of binge drinking on campuses or drinking on arch field projects. But it's a serious issue."
