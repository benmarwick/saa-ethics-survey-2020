"Principle 5: Intellectual Property"

"This principle falls short on two fronts. One, there are some kinds of information that collaborators and stakeholders may request that we never make public, based on their rights to privacy or cultural patrimony. Two, for the less sensitive information that constitutes the majority of data that archaeologists produced, \"limited and reasonable\" is ambiguous enough that it allows bad actors to hold on to data virtually in perpetuity. So there need to be more clear implications here -- guidelines about what kinds of datasets and workflows to make publically available and how to do it. And I think that we should require the primary datasets AND processing workflows referred to in all SAA journals to be made public, UNLESS the authors can clearly cite some ethical concern about their publication. We should also look into preregistering hypotheses before studies begin as a way to increase transparency in research design."
NA
"Yes, but defining the reasonable amount of time is tough.  Academic and other constraints on the time that scholars have to actually do and write their research are under huge assault, so undoubtedly many of us have unfinished projects and datasets that we would lose access to if the time was short.  We cannot control the things in life that make it difficult to get our favorite work done quickly."
NA
"Based on my research practice, which draws extensively on archival materials, I would add that we are responsible, in our use of information generated by our colleagues, to accord full and proper recognition of: (1) their organization and labors in generating primary data, and (2) the data integration and interpretive proposals that they have developed, which may be unpublished but available to subsequent researchers."
NA
"This is a difficult topic, and there is a broad spectrum of gray areas.  It might help to better define a set of circumstances.  For example, there is data produced at public universities using public funds and grants that should be made available after a reasonable period (from personal experience, I've been denied access to isotope data obtained over 30 years ago).   One the other side of the spectrum, there is data collected as personal research projects that might not get published quickly due to various issues and life circumstances."
"No archaeologist should take information to the grave - on the other hand, students must be taught respect of their elders and the protocol for requesting information and ensuring that they appropriately cite that access."
"We are all after the same thing  the interpretation of the past  and should strive to work together and not withhold information from other archaeologist."
NA
"It does not distinguish between archaeological objects and records of the study of objects. It does not address any legally mandated repository rules.  It applies to aspiration but probably not practice. I myself, have not held objects in my care for study so I cannot speak to the way public access would compromise my research."

"Information generated should always be shared with the descendant communities and they should have the opportunity to protect/restrict access to culturally sensitive information as part of their right to manage  their own heritage."
NA
"It can indeed take a *very* long time to complete certain research projects, especially labors of love."
"This should be updated to reflect best practices regarding FAIR data approaches. Open Access as the currently most ethical method of publication should be specifically mentioned here."
NA
NA
"\"a limited and reasonable time\" needs to be explicitly defined."
NA
"The SAA promotes plagiarism when it benefits students of famous faculty or prestigious institutions."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Sites don't belong to particular archaeologists."
"Again, this is woefully inadequate and incomplete.

The ethical problems of draconian copyright laws and the intrusive surveillance of commercial digital publishing platforms (not to mention social media platforms) get very little attention and discussion in the SAA.

Commercial archaeology largely generates commercial intellectual property, and academic archaeology generates books and papers that are mainly owned by commercial publishers. Access to all of these is restrictive and involves intensive surveillance (representing a threat to privacy and academic freedom). Withholding evidence for \"limited and reasonable time\" gets abused if there are so few positive incentives to motivate comprehensive data sharing.

The SAA needs do more than pay lip-service to the intellectual property issue. Archaeologists still have too many incentives to withhold and cherry-pick data. Perverse incentives to withhold evidence lead to many of the same negative externalities that make the antiquities trade so harmful. Bad \"publish or perish\" incentives lead to the loss of primary evidence and destruction of context because too many archaeologists lack the motivation to adequately share and archive their primary data.

"However we often get the public asking for some of these materials and they should not be given carte blanch access. Some of the research may be prohibited due to tribal concerns in general and not specifically. A person who did the research should be able to edit or have access to their own research. Why? Sometimes they make statements that are later proven false or that they would like to change to reflect that. For instance a survey may show no sites in doing all kinds of literature and aerial photo research and then a new technology comes along (like Lidar), and when you look at those same areas there are all kinds of sites that can be seen. I know that from personal experience. Its also now a great tool to check a contractors work. We had a contractor who should have found a large logging camp through both pedestrian and shovel test survey and it was not found. But Lidar found it. And it showed us how bad our contractor is."

"Again this feels very out of date. The concept of a \"limited and reasonable time\" has been cited by some archaeologists to restrict data to themselves for 20+ years! We need a stronger stance on data sharing and a commitment to archive data in publically available ways for future scholars."

"I agree but I know many professional archaeologists in the private sector as consultants who argue they should be free to conduct business as necessary including signing confidentiality, non-disclosure, and publication restriction agreements which all impede making project results available to others -- sometimes permanently."
NA
"What is the definition of 'intellectual property?' If archaeologists are stewards, they do not own the narratives of the past.  I feel that the choice of terminology is unfortunate."
NA
NA
"I feel here that some of the wording could be stronger --- that, as professionals, we should avoid putting ourselves in a position where we have contractual obligations to withhold our findings from the professional community"

NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Archaeologists need to get over the mind set of \"this is MY data.\"   Young professionals today feel that their field notes are their personal possession --NO!"
"What constitutes a limited and reasonable time needs to be defined. There are several researchers in my region who have been hoarding data from completed projects without publishing on these data longer than I have been alive. 

Also, data is regularly withheld from tribal communities who require the data for their own stewardship on sovereign land."
NA
"Calling this kind of knowledge intellectual property implies ownership and copyright protection. If the point is not to treat it as a personal possession, then don't call it intellectual property (this is its very definition). Maybe call it scholarship and make it clearer that site reports need to be published."
NA

"Reasonable time needs to be spelled out.  20 years is not a reasonable time"
NA
NA
"Actually, I would argue that until such materials are part of the historical record when the creator of that knowledge releases those materials to the public domain or until such time that copyright laws restricting administration to the creator expire.  I would not be in favor of any kind of principle that could be used to justify the confiscation of someone's personal or intellectual property just because others feel they have a right to know.  Now, if we are talking about possession of material culture removed from the record, then this is another matter, but someone's own measurement, observation, description, and interpretation of the record, I say that is overstepping the line."
NA
"see #1 answer. Need to break the traditions of professionals dying without publishing/releasing/repositing their data"

NA
NA
NA
NA
"Unfortunately people have widely different views of what is a limited and reasonable time.  It may be helpful to expand this principle to include a responsibility to bring in expertise that one or ones institution does not possess in order to examine archaeological data that the primary researcher cannot fully analyze on their own.  For example, my institution has no equipment to conduct certain kinds of ceramic analysis, so I share some ceramics with graduate students at institutions which do.  However many archaeologists hoard their sherds like they are money and they sit, unanalyzed, on a shelf in perpetuity because they wont let anyone else near them."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"There should be a stronger statement about making data available, especially but not exclusively, if collected with public funds."
NA
"This is one of the \"fuzziest\" areas of ethics in academia, especially as it pertains to archaeological field projects which are collaborative in nature, but which too often result in project directors co-opting the research of students and other colleagues on staff."
NA
"I suggest the need to consult with culturally affiliated descendant communities concerning the taking of, viewing of, curating of, publishing of, and teaching with digital or photographic images of skeletal remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony. Members of SAA shall abide by the wishes of culturally affiliated descendant communities concerning the use of digital or photographic images of the above materials."
"This principle appears to conflate two kinds of intellectual property,  (1) the material results and records of an archaeological survey or excavation, and (2) the intellectual knowledge that is generated via the analysis of such materials.  To the extent that this principle is concerned with the first, I agree.  To the extent that it extends to the second, it is personal intellectual property and it is up to the producer of that intellectual property, not the broader archaeological community to determine how and when (or even if) it is disseminated.  I would consider works for hire, such as contract or compliance reports to fall into the first category."
"The my site mentality  is alive and well in contemporary American archaeology."
NA

"But again, there may be caveats here if the materials belong to a particular group that still uses these items in their current practice."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Just because a specific archaeologist is in charge of a dig site does not mean that others should not have access to that data. A lot of people are not publishing their data for sometimes up to a decade after the excavation. This is inhibiting the entire community from having access to that knowledge. Also, unless a new method is developed in the process, the cultural record does not belong to the archaeologist who dug it up, it belongs to the descendants of the culture. Cultural material is not intellectual property."
"Mirrors language in RPA. If someone is sitting on data and shows no sign of using them, they should be compelled to make them available to others."
"This needs to be much more specific about \"limited and reasonable time\", and should also include direction for archaeologists to actively support sharing and access of archaeological data, especially with underprivileged communities, descendent communities, and broader publics."
NA
"I agree with this, but people don't often follow it. I'd like to see something in here that says if you publish on data, the data has to be made available. This ties back into my \"archaeology is science\" as the primary ethic."
NA
NA
NA
"A greater concern to me is how intellectual property is stolen by some unscrupulous people and archaeology related groups. This is quite common in the archaeological community."
NA
"This could be updated to account for ways to easily store and distribute data online (e.g., tDAR)."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Data archiving should be required"
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Stronger language needed here. This is a huge problem of egos. So much archaeo material and context are lost forever when individuals pass away before ever publishing, and deny even their own students ability to further research/publish on \"their\" collections. It's an outmoded 1950s-70s way of conducting research that needs to go away."
NA
"Some projects take a long time - involving field, lab and archival research. Archaeologists should not try to take over other researchers projects if those researches are still actively working on the projects."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"This is a core principle for academic archaeology, as well as archaeology in other contexts."
NA
"The only way to interpret this is that the SAA considers private property to be some kind of ethical breach.  The SAA has made a grave error in adopting these socialist positions."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"in some contexts, it may not be appropriate or possible to make the information available to everyone else (e.g., stakeholder or other institutional permissions, human remains)"
NA

NA
"Establishing definitions for \"limited and reasonable time\" would be useful."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"This principle is very weak. It is the obligation of the archaeological community to create broadly accessible long-term, repositories that have the capacity to authentic users and user credentials for use and access. It is the responsibility of archaeologists to contribute to these repositories in a timely fashion. It is also the responsibility of of hiring and funding institutions to recognize that the contribution of structured archaeological data is at least as important as published interpretations and reward such contributions with financial incentives. Failure to do so will foster a continuation of data hoarding practices that will imppede broad scale understandings of long-term historical trends using archaeological data."
NA
"I'm sick of hording and seeing everything as personal."
NA
"The phrase \"made available to others\" probably should have more detail."
NA
NA
NA
"Sometimes reports are created for a client who decides not to release the report or submit to an agency for review.  This document is the property of the entity that paid for it.  It is not always in the control of the archaeologist who developed the document.  ONe can advise and encourage the appropriate behavior but cannot control it."
"Often, IP that is recorded in the record belongs to OTHER people. This is critical. Also, there are confidentiality issues that should be addressed here."
NA
"While I strongly agree with the above statement, I also believe that a statement regarding the ethics of student research should be included within this tenet."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Maybe we need to say what a reasonable time is?  I know some archaeologists who have had artifacts from federal land in personal storage units for over 50 years.  Not reasonable."
NA
"I think the phrase \"limited and reasonable time\" needs to be defined.   Somewhere in the neighborhood of three to five years seems right to me.  Archaeologists not publishing information and restricting access to data and collections for decades is highly problematic."
NA
"This is not being followed and it is time for archaeological conferences to step up enforcement on this. Agency archaeologists, SHPOs, and tribes have seen an uptick in CRM companies presenting on projects without getting permission to do so. Students are also advocating for open sharing of data without fully understanding the adverse effects of this stance. We need to explain the confidentiality that is in the NHPA and other cultural resource laws to these students as well as descendent community perspectives so that they understand that data may not be public because it the legal and moral thing to do."
NA
"Archaeologist hoarding data is serious issue that is not given sufficient attention.  This also applies to archaeologists, who time after time, fail to complete contract/professional obligations to report their data and findings - yet professionally and commercially suffer no ill-consequences."
NA
NA
"Original data (notes, descriptions, minimally-processed data) is NOT considered intellectual property under copyright statutes since it does not convey an original expression of the author's idea or personality. This type of legally-unjustified mentality fosters a protectionist mentality that contradicts the second half of the principle. We need to view ourselves as temporary stewards of data; not as its creators or owners."
NA
"researchers rarely work alone, this principle should include something about the ethics of working with other scholars and students"
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"A start, but needs more.  See my comments elsewhere."
NA
NA
"Yes, though it should also be recognized that Native populations may not want certain materials and documents made public and the location of archaeological sites should not be made publicly available in order to decrease the chance of providing access for looters."
"I'd be more specific.  I have worked with archaeologists who don't even publish some of their finds in annual reports to the government, and some of them have left the field without ever reporting things.  What makes a good archaeologist is not the stuff you find but how you interpret it..."
NA
"I think that this principle could be updated with recommendations on what constitutes a reasonable limit and perhaps with guidelines about best practices regarding how the materials and documents can be made available to others. 
"
"I can imagine some folks pushing an open access policy here; not something I would endorse as a prescriptive principle."
NA
NA
NA
"Needs to take on much larger issue of IP-- as it regards indigenous knowledge/ support from stakeholders.   This one is very narrow right now-- addressing professionals who hold onto their own collections well beyond a reasonable amount of time.   IP is much bigger than this. 
"
NA
"What exactly constitutes a \"reasonable time\"? This needs definition."
"The properties developed, interpreted from valid research, and placed within an institutional or an agencies domain, once written, become public property by reason of scholarly responsibility to the world, not just to the profession. It should be understood in common principle that intellectual properties have the innate power to change the course of historical perception for a living population and or in addition, the future."
"I think language regarding timely publication should be inserted here."
NA
NA
"Not sure if something about open access should be added?"
"I think this language needs to be more inclusive of making research etc. available to the wider, non-academic/non-professional public."
"This is required by most funding agencies."
NA
"Not sure exactly what this means, but if someone invents something to help archaeological work, they should have the right to benefit from that intellectual property.  The same goes for computer programs.

I do think that data should be shared without intellecutal property benefits."
"Again, nice sounding, lofty statements, but it is hard to find this concern for intellectual property in the real world of archaeology or understand how this principle can be enforced.  Example: I see largely unsupported claims that making data public will increase threats to archaeological preservation used to justify in many states a heavy handed restriction to data.  Example: How is one to know that a professor has data when the professor does not provide information on acquired collections?"
"Yes, but I have found it more difficult to access some records ir objects from curatorial facilities than archeologists.  Do these records belong to them?"
NA
NA
NA
"Very general langage,  an aspirational goal only."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Yes indeed. Very few archaeologists I know include their in-country colleagues as co-authors. So strange. We do this now in Cambodia and the fact that I have done it since 1999 is starting to pressure others to do the same. Ditto with my 2000-2006 policy when editing a regional journal: I asked western authors to include their in-country colleagues as authors, and that little act has begun to change Asian archaeology (I exclude China here, because they have their own tradition).

Also: too many researchers will not share data, or collections, even though they never get around to publishing them. Sometimes the collections disintegrate or lose provenience during this time that nothing is done with them. That's just wrong."
"Be better about open access!!!"
"update with sharing of 3d renderings?"
NA
NA
"My personal experiences in obtaining access to what would beyond any reasonable doubt be classified as public domain material may be termed extremely frustrating. Plainly and simply stated, this situation was brought about by a selected number of archaeologists based in and around Nashville, Tennessee, who smugly sat on manuscript material for several decades and took the attitude that these materials were their personal property to hoard as they saw fit.  ."

"This needs to be substantially updated to promote open access of data and publications."
NA
NA
"I would add that as a discipline that promotes the concepts of science, the results and the core discoveries must be made available to other researchers for replication, re-testing and reinterpretation. Public access (with some limits for protection of the resource) is necessary to advance understandings and appreciations."
NA
"I would add that Indigenous communities should have special Intellectual Property rights to archaeological resources, where applicable."
NA
"I think this part \"If there is a compelling reason, and no legal restrictions or strong countervailing interests, a researcher may have primary access to original materials and documents for a limited and reasonable time\" should be more specific about what a reasonable amount of time is. I have heard of archaeologists keeping their data indefinitely, and this is not okay. I think the spirit of this principle is good."
"This makes sense at both a general intellectual and more pragmatic level. On the former, all scholars benefit when the reports, articles, etc. are widely and freely disseminated. On the latter, since much of our work is supported by public funds, the information should be made widely available."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Needs more detail on balancing the protection of sensitive cultural knowledge and site locations with the imperative to make knowledge public."
NA
NA
"The one difficulty with complying with this principle is that in some regions of this country, there are not safe archival locations for collections and the metadata that should accompany them."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"This principle interacts with the issue with long term data storage and open access publications. Both practices should be encouraged where they do not run against the local or federal limits placed upon the archaeologist; however, digitizing also requires the curation of digital material."
"This statement seems out of date, given current open access conventions."
"This principle's application harkens back to the legacy collections not being cared for and for theoretical articles given precedence over good old data presentation!"
NA
NA
NA
NA
"This is a major point of conflict in SE Asian archaeology right now and desperately needs addressing. Additional wording around co-ownership of data between the archaeologist and local collaborators/institutions would also be welcome - many white archaeos in SE Asia are claiming ownership of material even after it has been deposited in local museums and demanding they be consulted or added as authors to work on this material. It perpetuates colonialist power relations and (intentionally I think) inhibits the development of local expertise/leadership"
NA
NA
NA
NA
"what is limited and reasonable?"
NA
NA
"This message needs to be stated more strongly."
NA
NA
"I think that this principle is one of those in which archaeologists are of two minds. In general, most archaeologists will support it in theory. It is reasonable and, certainly, commendable to allow access to others after a reasonable time has passed. In reality, there are many reasons that an archaeologist would be reluctant to share data that they have spent, perhaps, years collecting and, for whatever reason, has not been able to finish analysis and reporting. This is a very difficult principle to have a black and white position on."
"Nice clause but without any precise indication of time, totally useless. Or refer to time as specified by local legal framework"
"We must recognize that descendant communities, although traditionally disenfranchised, have inherent rights to their own intellectual property, and that archaeologists operating ethically will respect those rights."
"There should be a statement that failure to allow reasonable access to colleagues and others can have a detrimental effect on the archaeological record."
NA
NA
NA
"The wording is awkward.  I think the idea is to make it possible for others to access recorded information, whether it is in digital or physical/form.  

A separate issues is that frequently CRM clients assert ownership over data and documents produced by projects, and archaeologists frequently go along with this--I think in opposition to this principle.  This should be strongly discouraged on ethical grounds."
"This is a big problem in academia and CRM projects as well. this does not adequately address the possessiveness practiced by archaeologists, nor does it adequately address descendant communities' intellectual property"
NA

NA
"A reasonable time limit should be defined - some people think 5 years is adequate, others 20"
"This is something that should probably be looked at closer by Members \"more in the know\" -- as we rely more on the internet, self publishing, Big Data, Open Source Data, etc., I keep finding myself wandering into gray areas as to what I'm supposed to cite, how to cite it, and how to use this information/programs/models/etc."

NA
"I would like to see SAA take a stronger stand here and say that is the obligation of researchers to ensure the curation and availability of the data they generate after such a limited and reasonable time (even if something similar is discussed in another principle). Perhaps specifics would be in order because there is plenty of evidence that \"data available upon request\" often doesn't work."

NA
NA
"I'd like to see our profession move toward immediate availability of data in summary form, with complete raw data availability within a few years. The availability should be through repositories that will house data in perpetuity and we should follow standards, like those proposed by Sarah Kansa, for curation and recording that is intelligible to others."
NA
"It's not \"My site\" or \"My area\".  Share the information to qualified archaeologists."
NA
"Needs to have a stronger statement about the researcher, after primary access to originals, is obligated to ensure that the records is curated for long term preservation and access by others."
"What is reasonable time?
I think some guidelines should be given and some means of extending a time frame in extenuating circumstances to be governed by SAA. Otherwise this statement is ridiculous!
"
"Could include more specific language to discuss methods for publicizing/making data accessible, while also highlighting what kinds of data should be protected (e.g., site locations that could be threatened by looting). While the SAA should not necessarily endorse specific digital data repositories, acknowledging their existence would be an important step (something you could not have expected in 1996, but should be updated)."

NA
"If said researcher does not publish an analysis of these results within a given frame, then the materials must be made available to others."

NA
"Is vague and seems concerned about about the use of materials by archaeologists. What about archaeologists IP? What about plagiarism? \"Limited and reasonable time\" is really vague. Needs to better define IP as well."
"Required accessible archive of excavation records is essential."
NA
NA
NA
"Too long and too vague - 'reasonable time' how long is that? If it was about ethics then one should make their work open and freely available right away - except when such work that would harm others i.e. people's personal information in this survey."

"Again, note that other countries may have different views of this. In Mexico as long as I am alive, use of collections produced by my research require my permission or acknowledgement for others to use them. A breach of this is considered quite serious."
NA
NA
NA
"The first sentence is ambiguous. How can IP belong to the archaeological record? I see two different senses in which IP adheres to that record. (1) It may be that the depositors of that record retain some IP rights over it; NAGPRA certainly takes that position for certain parts of the record. I think it would be very harmful to archaeology to see those rights expanded. (2) It is also the case that the acts of land ownership, excavating, recording, analyzing, writing up, making available to the public, and curating materials creates IP. In fact one might well believe that each step of this process creates some partible IP. Whatever position is taken on these issues, as written principle 5 is incomplete or unclear."
NA
"... assuming that there are no cultural restrictions on this material placed by indigenous communities."
"Reasonable amount of time should be more clearly defined. Younger scholars are facing greater administrative responsibilities that limit their time to devote to get publications out. \"Other\" should also be more clearly defined. Perhaps these items should be made available through the office of the SHPO or THPO to ensure that those consulting them have a legitimate interest in accessing that information."
"Part of this is academics have to actually publish their data. Too many engage in excavations & data collection w out doing so, and it's just looting. Not a problem in CRM."
NA
"People who hoard primary resources are liars. They game the system so only their interests and interpretation are available. If a researcher does not allow access to others they are definitely not ethical."
"Intellectual property has no place in scholarship. I see no compelling reason why a researcher should feel entitled to restrict access to material that uniquely document, and therefore are part of, humanity's common past."
"Additional information about forms of access that are appropriate and how to differentiate WHO is given access would be helpful here."
"Great on paper, but rarely enforceable in practice."
NA
NA
"I agree in principle, but this is extremely vague and does not actually capture the position and decisions that archaeologists must make when archaeologists publish their work. More detail is needed regarding what constitutes a published work, what additional documentation is needed to support the sustainable access and use of that work (especially regarding open data), and any commitments that should be encouraged on the part of those who access or use that work (i.e. reaching out to authors, citation, acknowledgement, etc)"
"Examples of ways that this knowledge could be shared would be useful, especially given the numerous options in our digital age (e.g., Open Context)."
NA
"I agree with the statement, but there are no clear actionable points here. We are now at a point where in order to get external funding, we need to have data accessibility statements. In my opinion, this should be updated to catch up to the federal standards of being explicit about how to share data."
NA
"Open access principles need to be made much stronger within this statement. Freely available in reasonable formats etc. Standards of data availability"
NA
NA
"It's not personal their possession or the possession of their clients.  Its a collective cultural heritage"
NA
"Its more complicated than this because its easy for someone else to come along, archive your work, and in a way \"own its intellectual rights\"."
"This needs to have much stronger wording. What does \"made available to others\" mean?"
NA
NA
"Again, this principle should account for the desires of the descendant communities as part of that stewardship principle. If relevant, the information should belong first and foremost to the people descended from those we are studying and not to the general public in the broadest sense, and should only be shared with the public if they deem it appropriate."
"This is a mess. Depends on what you are talking about. In general yes but everyone has different guidance on this. Baseline is that agency required documents should not be considered intellectual property and we should all share and make provisions for curation of our stuff at so e point."
NA

"I agree, but SAA has to be aware of its own behaviour, in seeking to control information from projects it commissions"

"Human remains and archaeological objects returned to Native American communities become their property.  So too should every record of those remains and materials such that any researcher should have to first secure the permission of the community to access those records.  The reasons for this basic ethical consideration are almost too obvious to point out, but just for illustration here's  perhaps the most obvious:  many communities will wish to reinter those remains and materials in the same location from whence they came.  Access to  that information just encourages more looting.

The legal liabilities for not taking this approach are substantial."

Is there no way that we can shift our way of thinking about knowledge generation to be one where our primary focus democratization? Can we not find a way for this to work while balancing the need for researchers to publish original material? I just feel that as a discipline, we need to think about this more.

Also, what about the generation of knowledge that would be helpful to publics? For example, if our work illustrated the pace of coastal erosion, wouldn't;t we want that shared immediately with communities who might be trying to preserve their heritage? They would need this information in order to make immediate decisions about management."

Some go so far to completely ignore contrary results by non-academics, choosing to believe that their material insignificant to be relevant to address.  Poor science."

"For me, the operative phrase is \"no legal restrictions\". The dissemination of this knowledge is essential if archeology is to grow. However, there must be careful consideration as to the consequences of sharing information. Even at the state level my interaction as a federal archeologist was hampered by their insistence that site location data would be shared (gotta get that trinomial, right?), but that the information would then be available on the state's internet for researchers and contractors. I insisted that unless the state would provide a firewall and involve me as the person directly responsible for what is otherwise unavailable information, even under a FOIA, I would not share data. I felt that I had the responsibility to know, and approve, of who was requesting access to this information. My bureau requested this three years in a  row and got no response from the state archeological survey."

Despite the challenge (risk) to our not-for-profit enterprise model, we try to find the time to answer all questions, whether from students, scholars, peers, the public, or tribes. In an extreme (and dysfunctional) extension of that responsibility, individuals (non-academic?) have misused the New Mexico \"Inspection of Public Records Act\" to force our office to do research for them that they could and should do for themselves. On the flip side, we have had tribes request the sequester of archaeological information, outside of any legal framework such as NAGPRA, where I am actually in fear that an Inspection of Public Records Act request will force me to violate the tribal request. Initial sequester requests have had a strong basis in cultural values, but increasingly we see sequester requests that appear to be based on sovereignty exercises, both as simply as an exercise of sovereign rights and as a means of damaging the cultural interests of other sovereigns."

Many archaeologists, especially academics, do not understand that the associated records, as defined in 36 CFR 79 for federal collections and in state/tribal/local laws, are the property of the landowner, now usually a government agency. The records, including analytical data, must be curated as part of the archaeological collection owned by the property owner (in cases of private land owners, hopefully transferred to a repository or an agency by via a Deed of Gift), even if no objects were recovered.  The text in the 3rd sentence -- \"no legal restrictions or strong countervailing interests\" -- is not adequately explained.  I just explained the \"legal restrictions\" that are very prevalent out there. What are examples of \"strong countervailing interests\"?

Who are \"others\" in the last sentence??  Really should be \"the public\".

I think it is simply public knowledge. So, for example, site locations are specifically exempted from FOIA because of the idea that public knowledge of site locations poses a danger to them. I think experience shows that in fact that far greater danger comes from the public NOT knowing where they are, because when the public is in the dark there is no push for protection in the face of development. I also think we need to re-evaluate the assumption that government agencies actually care about preservation. Once this is acknowledged, it becomes clear that limits on public access to information generated through archaeology actually undermines preservation. A generation ago looting was a primary mechanism behind site destruction--today, I think the primary mechanism is oil and gas development on public land."

I could imagine no circumstance that that researcher be forced to make their documents of study available to others if they do not want to.

This principle could be worded more strongly to say something like, short of an archaeologists' own writings on the subject, it is unethical for archaeologists to consider any part of the material record (including results of lab test, etc.) to their property.

Does all this hoarding and hiding of data from bad actors actually work? Are the negative consequences of it worse than the consequences or just releasing it all? No-one knows the answer to any of these questions, so the default position is just to lock everything down. This needs to change. There needs to be studies done of every stage of this line of reasoning, with a view to making evidence-based, case-by-case determinations of what should and should not be released -- and perhaps defaulting to open access unless a danger to heritage can be proven (rather than defaulting to the opposite assumption as we currently do )"

"Usually, in my experience, the countries where archaeologists work require archaeologists to file reports and records promptly with some relevant organization, such as a partrimony agency.  Then, anyone can ask to see those records.  However, I occasionally have run into a situation where a repository feels obliged to refuse to post publicly materials that a researcher has donated because of some feeling that access should be limited to individual researchers.  The Center for Research Libraries has refused to post publicly transcriptions of a particular researcher's transcripts and translations of records of accounts of an indigenous society, even though the researcher is now dead. The records are extremely important in establishing the existence of highly organized heterarchical societies before colonization, a finding that would very much benefit the descendants of those societies who are dealing with inaccurate and possibly disingenuous information from some groups of western researchers.  It would be good to include something about the need for repositories to make indigenous materials as publicy available as possible when there is no compleling reason why they should be restricted."
"Archaeological sites are not intellectual property, yet many consultants treat the materials within (especially human remains) as such. I understand that research is vital, but I know in the past it has been used by some to further careers rather than public/ descendant community knowledge.

"I think this should be made stronger. Maybe I'm wrong, but basically I read this as saying that researchers can maintain primary access to their materials for a while, so they can receive due credit through publications, but the ultimate goal is eventual open access. This is worth stating explicitly, and ties back to the previous principle about public education and accessible information. Some universities offer funds to publish open access - maybe its worth calling for this to become more widespread and better funded? On the other hand, there are a number of complexities here - I know I certainly don't have the knowledge to create a public database of my materials.

However, not all information is appropriate for open access. Again, my expertise is in Indigenous contexts, where some information is not appropriate for certain outsiders or social groups. I know sociolinguistics have developed databases for public projects in which users have limited access to materials on the basis of things like clan and gender."

"The protection of IP has moved on a lot since this was written. This is is limited to IP \"created through the study of archaeological resources\" - members create IP that is generated from other activities.
This principle does not protect the work the archaeologist has done - indeed, quite the opposite.
I think this conflicts with current best practice and needs to be completely reconsidered."

"Again, great principle, sometimes shakey execution.  Lots of researchers often don't want to share their data.  I would add, it is important to make publications open source as much as possible to increase the ability of a diverse range of people to engage with archaeology.

"Not disagreeing with the sentiment, but this is unrealistic on the count of fairness.

"I strongly agree with the first two sentences.  But, I do not think there is general, wide spread agreement on what \"a limited and reasonable time\" is.  I have seen academic researchers tie up collections for years by requesting them through loans for years, as they struggle to conclude their research.  They drag their feet, or are completely oblivious to requests for returning the material so that others can access it.  This is a principle that appears to be systematically abused."

Few universities give a hoot about faculty's legacy data or collections.

The whole problem of legacy data, collections, archives, and orphan collections is neglected."

These peer reviews should be represented by professionals without an allegiance to the contractor generating the report or entity wishing to impact the area. Information regarding this should be made public in a redacted form to make the public aware there are potential challenges, but no specific information should be made readily available to the public without proper consideration to preserve integrity in the event impact is averted. In the instance of areas that will be adversely impacted without significant findings environmental assessments and such should made immediately available once construction is completed but not prior to construction to the public."

"In general, the idea of intellectual property is similar today as it was in the mid-90s. Yet, there are numerous additional institutions (university, govt, federal agencies, private funders) at play today with complex rules about property rights. As always, this differs whether conducting work in the US or elsewhere. importantly, this principle does not take into account the rights of stakeholders -- especially community members of the lands directly affected -- or the different types of datasets that are common today. Enormous datasets generated from traditional fieldwork and remote sensing may have different codes regarding intellectual property."
NA

"The beginning of this principle is too vague, applying to \"knowledge and documents\" while the end seems very specific - making prescriptions for how a hypothetical researcher might access specific information. It needs to be reworked so that it makes a bit more sense.

In addition, legal restrictions and countervailing interests should not be dismissed. Information on site locations, for instance, is especially sensitive, both from a legal standpoint, and from the point of view of tribes and other community members who may object to the sharing of particular information. In addition, researchers need to be able to safeguard sensitive information if they are granted access to it."

"The idea that sites or collections \"belong\" to an individual must stop. As in many of the sciences, a researcher should have sole access for a period of time in which to study and publish the material. But after that, it should be accessible to other researchers. The qualification on that is that some materials should not be generally accessible if for cultural reasons they should not be widely studied and published (sacred materials, for instance).

Entities charged with protection of sites should determine who has permission to explore sites, this should not be the decision by the person who discovered the site."

"I agree with the sentiment but I think that first sentence is a bit odd and doesn't clearly . Intellectual property is part of the archaeological record?  Why not just say \"documents pertaining to and created during archaeological study, including but not limited to those pertaining to field recovery methods, location, conservation, or analysis of artifacts, features, and structures, are part of the archaeological record? That would also encapsulate the lab analysis part of things, which I don't think is clearly articulated here."

"Another one that too few archaeologists actually follow, and for which there is too little enforcement by journals. It should also be amended for the digital era; in addition to the knowledge and documents created through the study of archaeological resources, it should include those tools designed and created to effect that study, where relevant. For instance, the GIS analyses, statistical tools, scripts, code, etc. used to derive published results should be made available. This is already standard practice in many \"hard\" science fields, most notably biology. In a timely note, the COVID19 crisis has provided many examples where the required publication of supporting data showed that the research and conclusions coming from some sources was simply of poor quality or erroneous. It would be interesting indeed to have this degree of transparency in archaeological research publications."
"I would like to see some that addresses Traditional Knowledges (TKs) specially. For example: http://www.indigenousgeography.net/ Or UNESCO's best practices. There are many out there and I feel archaeology is not dong enough work to create anti-racist policy and our colonial history.

I also had a scholar tell me that I was their stealing research since they wrote one report on the subject in 2007 but I was writing my thesis in 2015 and was elaborating on their research and giving them credit throughout. I believe an emphasis should be placed on scholars releasing their reports within a given time period and that it is unethical to allow scholars to view unpublished work when they request it. I also believe that there should be a bigger emphasis placed on the section about archaeological documents & reports are part of the archaeological record and should not be viewed as a personal possession."

"As a collections manager, unsupervised researcher access is a double-edged sword. Research on legacy collections is exactly why those collections exist. However, many simply do not have the attention to detail required to maintain a sort of chain of evidence required to piece together legacy collections.

There should also be more emphasis on materials and documents available to others INCLUDING digital records, reports, and other scientific calculations."

-Why are we supposed to continue citing the work of known sexual harassers in peer-reviewed publications?"
