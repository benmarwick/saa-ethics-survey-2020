The erosion of long-term academic employment (not just tenure, but continuity) deeply affects both undergraduate and graduate education, as well as the ability to direct continuing research. I consider that the SAA needs to develop a position on this issue.

There is no strategic planning to provide training in all aspects of archaeological analysis essential to work with the collections we generate. Instead, jobs and courses emerge in response to market trends in education (eg. bioarchaeologists who can teach premed students, GIS specialists who can teach planners), while important branches of our field lack anyone employed to teach them. The SAA could create a forum to identify these gaps and co-sponsor a graduate seminar in one or another specialty at a participating university, providing at lease temporary employment for a specialist and an opportunity for a cohort of students. </td> </tr>

Maybe I'm not the person to bring this up because while I've always been taught that I was to be an advocate for the resource, my paycheck rarely has had a deadline attached to it.  other archaeologists have told me about projects where large sites were investigated with four 1X1 meter units before a pipeline went through. In my early days I was on a survey of a couple of thousand acres with 20% visibility and an average shovel test interval of 1 per acre. (Now I would sue a company that tried that.) I've been on 'surveyed' public lands and found  several, fairly large, lithic scatters.

Some might argue that this falls under the purview of museums or NAGPRA, but both of those are limited in terms of what they can do, and archaeologists should take more responsibility for the removal of cultural material from where it belongs (even if that removal happened generations ago).
