"Principle 6: Public Reporting "
NA
NA
"I agree but it is not easy for scholars to get their results published. This is especially true for studies with null results. Maybe we need other avenues of making this information available (other than journals)."
"There needs to be an expansion about digital (though still protected) access, esp. given current limitations on travel. It highlights the need for accessibility and what accessibility means on multiple levels - such as by descendant or other stakeholder community members who may not be able to travel to access materials."
NA
"See answers to previous questions -- not all information \"wants to be free.\" Some needs to be protected -- and not just when it puts archaeological sites at risk of destruction, which this principle seems to suggest is the main concern. Consultation with collaborators and close stakeholders must be a central part of any dissemination or publication plan."
"As the curator of poorly documented and haphazardly curated collections, I wish we could put teeth into this."
NA
NA
"To be adequate, this statement must be modified. The principle is correct, but different types of archaeological analysis require different time frames. Those who study site distribution and architecture reap the first wave of results from survey or excavation, now further facilitated by improved remote sensing and documentation methods. They publish quickly and may seem highly ethical according to this measure, while the time-consuming processes of analyzing different types of excavated materials are left to \"slower\" meticulous colleagues who publish later, and are therefore less likely to be the PI, tenured, funded etc. Too often, the Director moves on to another high profile project, a situation that generates problems in conserving both the data and physical collections, and continues to be rewarded for rapid publication."
NA
NA
"This is a particular problem with compliance archaeologists - who continue to hoard materials under desks and in corners rather than pay for appropriate curation. Much of this material, as far as I can tell, has never even been processed."

"A per last question. The information should be reviewed by descendant communities first and they should have the opportunity to restrict public access to culturally sensitive information."
NA
"It can indeed take a *very* long time to complete certain research projects, especially labors of love."
"See previous answer."
NA
"As articulated, this statement does not give adequate attention to the rights of Indian tribes or project sponsors. Also, the verb \"must\" runs counter to the fact that many of us have unpublished projects in our hopper. Perhaps \"should\" is a better verb here?"
"\"Must\" is a strong word. What happens when one doesn't attain that aspirational goal?"
NA
"Archaeologists should publish data and site reports but many do not."
NA
"With the caveat that if an investigation (e.g. an archaeological inventory) has been conducted and the archaeological record (i.e., actual archaeological deposits or artifacts) wasn't involved (i.e., there were no archaeological materials identified) that the reporting and curation of this \"negative findings\" information should not be overly burdensome (which it currently can be depending on the involved organizations and governmental agencies)."
NA
NA
NA
"Again, this is woefully inadequate and incomplete.

See my prior comment. Data publishing and archiving needs to be mandated as an integral aspect of good professional conduct. Currently, our profession has too many financial and recognition rewards for behaviors that neglect data, thereby destroying key contextual information."
"I mean, yes, but SAA saying this is a bit rich.  How much does it cost to be an SAA member?  How much do SAA conferences cost?  How much will San Francisco cost?? Hiding behind the high cost of attendance and membership is not \"accessible\"."
NA

"We need to promote more interactive publications rather than standard reporting processes in order to capture the generation of today's professionals (managers, clients, funders) and interested public."

"How does this apply to gray literature?  Most archaeological work in the US today is done by CRM firms, but in many cases the results are not widely disseminated (so you don't even know about them except through personal connections), and even if you learn about their existence, they can be impossible to access.  Can we change this?  Can we make it mandatory (or at least strongly advised) for CRM firms to place their gray lit in regional or national repositories?  This is easily done with pdfs.  tDAR is a great start...but it only really covers the SW, and a lot of firms still aren't doing this."

"Given our modern digital age, this should really be revised and updated to encourage immediate sharing of primary data. Archaeology is lagging behind many other scientific fields in this regard, and it can be unreasonably difficult to get archaeologists to share data that they have used in publications. 

For example, I have requested lab numbers (and other basic information) for radiocarbon dates presented in publications within the last 10 years, and have had multiple authors refuse to provide them. If radiocarbon dates are used in publications, they should be open for scrutiny by any archaeologist who wishes to see them. A request should not even be necessary, they should be digitally available. If archaeologists do not want to share data, then they should not publish with it.

Archaeologists are also increasingly relying on self-written computer code for statistical analyses. This should ALWAYS be made available (they are simply text files, there is little to no reason that they cannot be hosted somewhere online), but this is, unfortunately, not always the case. Effort should also be made to make this code legible."
NA
"The biases that exist among journals in terms of what they will publish, length, etc. works against the widespread distribution of foundational data. In addition, too often I have read peer reviewed pieces that fail to cite relevant and significant drata to be found in publications and journals that are not peer reviewed.  There's a real elitism at work here. For example, well known author Brian Fagan does not deal with the results of CRM archaeology in crafting his synthesis of North American archaeology."

"Please see my response to Principle 5."
"This is great if it actually happened, yet we still have thousands of boxes of unanalyzed material languishing in University, State and Federal museums with no apparent plan or even intention to deal with them. This is a huge ethical problem for the discipline and one that engenders distrust from not only descendant groups, but the public at large in general"
"Most archaeologists working now are in CRM, and don't necessarily have the time to publish their work other than in reports (which are often privileged). It would be easier to comply with this principle if they did have time, but the difficulty should be acknowledged. Besides time constraints, many CRM archaeologists are probably discouraged from attempting publication because the most well-respected journals don't necessarily entertain those kinds of datasets in their publications."
"I believe the language could be even stronger here, as this is the principle which is likely most systematically violated in archaeology, broadly."
NA
NA
"This statement is extremely aspirational, given the difficulty many of us have finding outlets for publishing our research. This is especially true for American Antiquity, which only publishes papers written with a strictly scientific lens that are of relevance to only a portion of the SAA membership, much less a wider readership.

Also, finding archives willing to accept archaeological research archives in perpetuity is a challenge for some of us."
NA
NA
"with the caveat that in some cases that info may have to be in the language of the group to whom those materials belong or where permission might have to be sought for 'outsiders' to have access."
NA
NA
"I think archaeologists have an uneven record on this"
NA
NA

"When I began working in archaeology in the 1970s, perhaps the majority of academic archaeologists considered presentation of one's research to the general public to be unprofessional. To do so could cost one a career. I always thought this was wrong. Who surrendered to academic archaeologists the right to own the past? In my view an understanding of the rights of all stakeholders to the archaeological record is one of the major ethical advances of the past fifty years."
"This principle could be combined with principle 5"
"Again, \"reasonable time\" should be specified. I know many, many archaeologists who sit on \"their\" data for decades before writing even a field report. They forbid their students from doing so. Then they pass away and nothing ever gets published. This is unethical in every way, for all stakeholders."
NA
"Assuming you can get an established (i.e. will be here in the future) institution (e.g. museum, university, or governmental agency) to take on this task. I am very concerned that with CRM many of these wonderful collections will be gone in the future."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Sometimes research provides negative information that has little value to the general public."

"I agree with this principle. The hard thing about this is peer-reviewed publications are what get people jobs and tenure in academic archaeology, not other forms of reporting and publishing. I know it is not within the scope of the SAA necessarily, but a very real issue in archaeology is the academic institution holds scholars back from reaching wider audiences."
NA
NA
"My only disagreement here is the site location protection issue. I truly believe that we shoot ourselves in the foot trying to be so secretive about sites in the interest of protection. The locations of historic sites are often part of the public record, and collectors know better where most precontact sites are than archaeologists do so we gain nothing by restricting public access to our reports. Community engagement is a better strategy in an age when people (rightfully) demand access to the data their tax dollars paid for. Empowering the community by letting them know of the rich resources in their area so they want to help protect them is a benefit, and I think that benefit outweighs the rare instances where people will abuse the knowledge."
NA

NA
NA
"Rather than \"to as wide a range of interested publics as possible\", please change to as wide as appropriate.
The sentence about permanent safekeeping seems to belong more in the Stewardship principle.  Also, with all the references to the public here, it leads me to wonder why this isn't part of public outreach.  If you point is that we need to write up our work, make the principle \"reporting and publication\" and make it seem less addressed to the public.  The duty to write up is in a roundabout way to the public, but we aren't writing all reports for them."

"As with public outreach and education- --- archaeology needs to be doing much more in public reporting. We need to find a way to communicate more about archaeology around us-- in our cities, in our towns. Right now--with the extreme concerns over confidentiality-- it is very difficult to highlight the remarkable things that have happened \"right here'. 

I realize that US property and other laws create challenges with sharing site locations in specific ways--but in some states, the records are so confidential, even city managers do not know what recorded sites exist in their communities.  It is almost possible to engage the public about our rich past when we are not able to share what we know in meaningful local contexts.  We need to find a way to find better balance here."
"I am unsure in what ways that publications are available to the general public"
NA
NA
NA
"Maybe some inclusion of open access publication"
NA
NA
"Elaborating further on the means and methods for making our work accessible outside of academia is necessary."
NA
NA
NA
"Again, nice sounding, lofty statements, but it is hard to find this concern for reporting in the real world of archaeology or understand how this principle can be enforced.  Example: I see largely unsupported claims that making data public will increase threats to archaeological preservation used to justify in many states a heavy handed restriction to data.  Example: In my experience I feel that there is a good deal of snobbery in the lack of respect for CRM reports (gray literature)."
"but not to publics necessarily. Not the same publication to all publics. But definitely accessible to those who need access."
NA
NA
NA
"Also very general language, aspirational only."
"This is one of the places where we have really failed. Curation of both archaeological materials and records is in a terrible state of disarray, and funding for this is minimal."
NA
NA
NA
"Many archaeologists I know love to do fieldwork. So do I. But these archaeologists hate to stop to analyze and write up what they've done. They seem to think that the very act of going into the field makes them productive, and that kind of performative mindset hurts the profession.

I was delighed, some years back, when the indubitable Egyptian archaeologist Zawi Hawass halted ALL FIELDWORK BY FOREIGN TEAMS IN EGYPT. All of it. He said that people had to first cough up more reports and publications, and then he'd let them back in the country. 

I can imagine that working with Zawi Hawass could be quite a challenge, but I applaud his decision. We need more of that."
"Still open access is the best plan. Need to focus more on that."
NA
NA
NA
"Depositing materials \"in a suitable place for permanent safekeeping\" sounds well and good but in reality no end of \"gray literature\" materials are stashed away in agency file cabinets never to see the light of day again. The public which funds these studies derives no benefit from them and for that matter they are effectively of no use to professionals who know nothing of their existence."
NA
"Knowledge is fluid. Too often, freezing knowledge at a certain point in time through hard publications (books, articles, reports) creates a sort of permanence that is hard to undo and redirect. On the other hand, no publication hinders access to knowledge. I am in favor of more dynamic publications that can easily alter as more knowledge is gained (perhaps websites, dynamic public displays, or virtual reality installations). But institutions set up to reward the former, and lack of infrastructure to support the latter, make it difficult."
NA
"This is one of the biggest ethical issues I face as a Federal archaeologist.  It is often hard to present information to the public without disclosing site locations.  One also has to constantly be mindful in the digital world we live in that government reports are often digitized and put on the internet by tech companies like google.  Just last week I discovered that a major ethnographic report for the National Park I work in was digitized by Google and put on the internet for all to see.  It disclosed many confidential site locations.  This is the second time I am having to put in a request to google to take archaeologically sensitive government reports off of their google books pages."

"Reports, journal articles and other publications need to be publically available to all and not just current students and faculty at academic institutions. Currently this is not the case. Academic libraries are far more restrictive now about access especially to e- resources than when they were only print based."
"I would impose a 5 year time limit."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"While I agree with the sentiment, there is the issue of how quickly publications can be prepared, especially for those archaeologists in a college/university setting where teaching, committee work, and other responsibilities detract from time available for writing. At a minimum, however, field work should be reported in the form of presentations at professional meetings and to the general public as researchers work toward publication in journals or books."

"I believe that people are really committed to curating their data, but as one who works with their data, it isn't always done with the future in mind.  Documentation of what was done and why and the storage of artifacts so that you can reproduce the original results is oftentimes sorely lacking."
NA
"I agree with the sentiments here. The only issue is who determines what is a reasonable time. I have seen instances where this issue has been used by outside entities to attack or try to discredit colleagues or agencies. The size, duration, and complexity of the project, as well as the funding or lack thereof must be taken into account in these cases. I'm not sure if it is appropriate here, but a footnote or statement could encourage dissemination in the form of interim reports or papers in cases of long-term projects. This is of course done in most cases, but it helps to satisfy complying with this principle."
NA

"More emphasis needs to be placed on the timely manner and emphasis on a permanent location."
NA
NA
"This is another rather difficult principle, but I am sure that most, if not all, archaeologists would support it. Many, many roadblocks may occur to keep a project from reaching this ideal. There is usually not enough money to thoroughly analyze and report on a project, there are not always sufficient outlets where it may be published, and depositing of both data and artifact collections are among the most contentious issues facing our field. As a Corps of Engineers report many years ago reported for California alone, 40% of artifact collections from CRM projects were held by private contractors because there was no place else for them to go, either due to lack of money and/or institution where they could be curated."
"same remark as before"
"Here again, we should explicitly state that interested publics include but are not limited to descendant communities, landowners, legally compliant private artifact collectors, and the general public. We need to enshrine this in this principle because archaeologists are terrible about attending to the dissemination of data to all interested publics, perhaps because they refuse to recognize that they do not get to cherry-pick which publics to prioritize."
NA
"In many cases, there is no way for people to make their data accessible. If you leave the field and have data, but cannot make that data freely available without spending personal time and money, does that make you unethical or does that highlight an issue with the field? Though we would like to think we can make data available through publications, this is not always the case. We need to establish better means by which archaeologists can make data freely available."
NA
NA
"Making clear this applies to digital records would be good.  In this born digital age, in many cases these are most or all of the records"

NA

"When this was written, a conference presentation and physical publication were the two avenues for reporting results; today we can post on Facebook, create a blog, and more. The principle needs to be rethought toward guidelines for how this occurs in the mid-21st century"
NA
"The last line in this principle is one of the biggest challenges I see us facing with increasingly open data and I hope the SAA is working on potential solutions. How can we share data that scientists need to replicate results or do new analyses without endangering resources?"
NA
NA
"This needs clearer explanation and application"

"Separating intellectual property (Principle 5) and Publication (Principle 6) separates the idea that our data and notes are themselves things worth publishing as part of a site's (or project's) archaeological record and fall under our ideal of stewardship. It may be worth consolidating these two principles, as separating them makes it feel like publishing results and publishing data follow different trajectories/goals.

Could also include more specific language regarding accessibilty (e.g., promoting the use of Open Access publishing when possible)."

"This one's fine. Even less sure now what Principle 5 means. Does it mean that people should make artifacts available for reexamination or something?"
NA
NA
NA
"Too many archaeologists are not publishing the results of their work and making their data widely accessible. This is true of both academic and CRM archaeologists."
NA
"Again, the definition of \"public\" here is rarely followed (a presentation to the SAA meetings is not a public presentation and even a journal article is borderline). Also, would be great for SAA to advocate for CRM companies who struggle with having clients fund public materials."
NA
"This is clear and a strong statement."
"Also transparent practices and documentation of the final disposition of artifacts, including object numbers, catalogs, illustrations, which were discarded."
NA
NA
NA
"Again could be summed up as, Open - Open Access, Open Data, Open Source. Open always and quickly - except where it can hurt people."
"In Washington State many consulting archaeologists defer to private landowner's wishes not to have sites reported to SHPO. I think it is unethical and should result in the archaeologist who withholds site information from SHPO of being suspended from doing further work in the state."
NA
NA
"However, it may not go far enough. There is a disciplinary failure to publish that is widespread globally, and a failure to integrate academic data and grey-literature data that means large proportions of the work done by archaeologists is either inaccessible or extremely hard to access. Publication and public availability of data should be a binding obligation. SAA and other organizations should take the lead in addressing this issue."
NA
"Note: when working in Latin America primarily Spanish is the language for the public, students, and many colleagues. Fully 50% of my publications are in Spanish.

"Now very out of date with regard to norms of publishing and data sharing in science. It is not just the 'knowledge' that scholars produce needs to be published, but the complete set of data and methods that led to it. This is especially important in archaeology where our data often comes from the destruction of irreplaceable common heritage. It also makes no mention of what qualifies as 'accessible': once publishing in a subscription-only journal from a commercial publisher, with a note that 'data is available on request' would be enough, but the current standard should be open access with openly licensed text and data.

I do not think the preservation of archaeological sites is significantly aided by obscuring their location, certainly not enough to outweigh the problems this causes for open scholarship, but I realise this practice is more common in the Americas than elsewhere in the world."
"While I agree entirely with this one, I feel that it is likely the least followed of the principles! Perhaps guidelines about what is a reasonable time should be offered or we should be more explicit about the guideline such that it emphasizes this includes both scholarly and public sharing of the results."

"Again, this principle should account for the desires of the descendant communities as part of that stewardship principle.

"Nevertheless, there continues to be a bureaucratic tightening up of release of field work results, even for among local professional colleagues, for work on federal lands despite the fact that much of the information is general knowledge among the public from Facebook and other means.  Although widely acknowledged that it may increase visitation--even though public visitation is encouraged on these very public lands--the majority of sites are little worthy of pothunting attention and yet the lack of archaeological dissemination hampers the very agency management and those archaeologists who also work in the area from generally knowing the cultural resources and being able to adequately plan or manage them."

"At what point does unpublished excavation information cease to be an individual's intellectual property and become a de facto public record?  For example, in 1961, the Onondaga Pen site, NY (a late 17th/early 18th century mortuary site) was excavated by an archaeologist.  This individual has continued to treat the excavation records as personal property even after more than 50 years.  Not only has he been unable to complete a report, he has refused yo make the information available to other scholars as well as the federally recognized tribe (Onondaga Iroquois).  His current plan is to bequeath these records to his alma mater (University of Michigan) rather than a responsible institution in New York, such as the New York State Museum.  

The question is - what is the SAA's position and/or role in helping to enforce this ethical principle in practice?"
NA
NA
"I see this regularly ignored by some who take decades to publish their research or work on numerous sites and put out a 1 page summary document.

"Use of reporting formats that lend themselves to easy redaction of specific site location information is a good practice.  I'm not fooling myself thinking that the looters don't know more than we do, but we still have to do the right thing. Sadly, in my former bureau (NPS), there was a system in place that classified all reports as to three categories: available, available with redactions, and restricted. When or why that went by the board is unknown to me and I look with horror at my own reports available on-line on Amazon or Bookfinders.com that reflect years of careful survey and reporting, now made easy pickings for looters."

It is not so much that the researcher has not published/presented on it, but rather that the data is being withheld from researchers completely during this time. So, what might be a \"reasonable\" time?"

"This is an important principle, but it has some gaps.  The emphasis on publication is a bit much when the \"other means\" of \"public reporting\" aren't stated. They could be museum exhibits (either in a repository or online); public programming, i.e., lectures, teaching kits; or wayside signs on a trail, among other things.  The emphasis on \"publication\" caters to academics, which are not the majority of the archaeologists out there now. Most CRM and gov't archaeologists don't publish since there are no business incentives to do so.

It needs to be explicit that the research can be of either sites or collections!  

The 2nd sentence is problematic.  Suggest something like \"The associated records -- documents and analytical materials on which all forms of public reporting are based--, should be curated in a repository or archive for permanent safekeeping according to applicable laws, regulations, or policies.\" 

The last sentence is fine for sites.  However, there needs to be an additional, similar sentence that all publications and public reporting should identify the repository where the collection is curated for future access and use. It could say something like: \"An interest in preserving and enabling future access to archaeological collections must be taken into account by identifying the repository where the collection, whether objects and associated records or associated records only, are curated in all forms of public reporting.\""

Archaeologists can certainly post their unpublished reports or file them in archives but I feel that there should be some other arrangement that could provide for the publication of such unglamorous materials in ways that would be relatively lasting.

"I have the same question as my earlier statement that not all information is appropriate for all audiences. However, is a potentially underfunded archive or even the attics of community leaders a \"suitable place for permanent safekeeping\"? I think that if there is a descendant community interested in claiming the materials, they should have the primary claim - although I understand that would be an extremely complex determination in many cases). But the alternative is reproducing colonial relations in which Indigenous materials are unilaterally claimed as national heritage. Of course, many tribes have excellent museums and preservation capacities, and many might prefer objects to be kept in a university or museum with those capacities, but I think these are issues that the SAA needs to tackle head on."

I would also suggest taking the \"reasonable time\" thing out of this paragraph. I think it's covered earlier in a more appropriate place, and I think if you expect professionals to make their results available in easily digestible formats for the general public, you need to ease off of the time restriction. Formal publications are always going to take precedence, as they should, over popular articles or presentations. General public knowledge dissemination is imperative, absolutely--but it has to be at a lower priority than publishing in professional arenas where all of the relevant knowledge can be accessed ASAP."

"All researchers and archaeologists should subscribe to the FAIR Principles (Findability, Cccessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse), in conjunction with an obligation to Indigenous Data Sovereignty  and the CARE Principles (Collective benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics).  The days of the lone scholar are long gone!  This very much needs to be revisited and more systematic data management plans should be a required part of ANY project regardless of scale."
"Unfortunately the agencies that fund archaeological investigation have little interest in funding this principle"
"Again, a nice thought. Compliance and enforcement is laughable in the academic context, somewhat better in CRM. Perhaps defining \"within a reasonable time\" more clearly would be a good start. Tangentially, data might be more readily disseminated if the community were more open to the publication of negative results (a problem in all scientific publishing)."

"For those archaeologists working in the CRM industry, it can be difficult to publish via traditional means. The gray literature produced by CRM archaeologists is very important, but, without presenting papers at conferences (a relatively simple task) it may be difficult to know what work has been conducted."

"Principle 6: Public Reporting and Public Reporting addresses many of the short comings of Principle 5 for making information popularly available. However, Principle 6 still does not directly address the issue of working with descendant peoples and cultural groups about the appropriate presentation of information that may be sensitive to them. This Principle once again sets the archaeologist as the ultimate purveyor of archaeological truth, without acknowledgement of the possible involvement of others directly in the decision making."

"I am an advocate for open science, so I personally think there needs to be more emphasis here on making archaeological data and knowledge public within a reasonable amount of time. I think it's perfectly acceptable for archaeologists to keep information private prior to publication. However, once published data should be made as accessible as possible. Archaeologists also need to publish or share their data in reasonable time frame! It is unacceptable to keep research unpublished for 10 years (or more), as we all know horror stories of sites not being reported, artifacts lost, etc."

"'permanent safe keeping' is to be discussed.  How long should the materials be sored,a rchived? storage is not everlasting.
How long? What has to be undertaken first?
Can the materials be re-used by another discipline? An artist, for example?

"This principle is probably the most challenging of them all. Obviously, reporting is important. Publishing is great. But who is really graced with the amount of time to do this?? Tailoring reporting to all interested parties is incredibly time-consuming, and ultimately leads to halfhearted efforts that perpetuate the perception that archaeologists are ivory-tower types who hoard data. Public outreach is a special skill, and many do not have it. Is it maybe better that its done less frequently with greater quality vs. done frequently with poor results?"

"could be more prescriptive rather than aspirational here, for example, with the growth of social media, on-line platforms and digital media, there are now more ways to share research and findings on the archaeological record to the general public, perhaps an emphasis on ways in which the SAA can facilitate the sharing of research and findings"

"I strongly agree this is important but it does not apply to challenges today. Wide arrange of publications- that's certainly not the case. I also think this needs serious examination as sites are being destroyed and impacted by climate change at a more rapid rate- a living document to deal with balancing site location sensitivity with the fact many sites won't be around the next season. \"An interest\" is made law in many states, where it's no longer appropriate, to the detriment of public awareness of site destruction not by looting."

"I feel that most academics do not adhere to this principle. As graduate students, we are told to publish publish publish... in academic, pay-walled journals. We are ACTIVELY DISCOURAGED from writing for public audiences, having archaeology blogs, writing op-eds, etc. or disseminating knowledge to the general public in any meaningful way. To me, this principle needs to be broadened and be explicit that it is not good enough to only report and publish in the echo chamber that is academia. We should not only be writing for ourselves."
