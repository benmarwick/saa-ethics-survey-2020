"Community involvement in South Africa is somewhat different than in the US. We have black (this is an acceptable term here) majority rule. To most black South Africans, ritual places and human burials are the most sensitive subjects. We have another problem in that black political leaders do not care about the Stone Age past or about San/Bushmen peoples. We therefore have the added problem of protecting archaeological resources in spite of government indifference."

"The US and Canada have both subscribed to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous peoples and SAA must follow suit."
"AS in my prior answer, the SAA Principles have for the most part NOT addressed issues beyond the contexts of archaeology in the United States, or perhaps the Americas. Among such issues are the roles of American archaeologists in training people in developing countries, collaborating with archaeologists in the countries in which they work, and understanding the different cultural contexts of archaeology in countries other than the United States."

"Working in a place where people earn less is a challenge. We have a responsibility to keep people employed year round, but we can't because of limited resources. How can our field address this?

"I agree with the principles, but they do not satisfactorily address all of these issues. Neocolonialism and collaboration are not addressed in any way.

"It doesn't address all of the challenges of working in Mexico, where archaeologists may be barred from sharing educational materials derived from their research with local Native populations and INAH is resistant to including this population in making decisions about stewardship."
"I work in a country with a long history of oppression against the Indigenous population and a recent genocide.  Archaeologists need to actually and actively reach out to descendant communities and work with them and archaeology should be undertaken for their benefit and through collaboration with them rather than just the standard positivist bullshit we are taught to believe in.  Archaeology is not objective and the archaeological record does not belong to everyone equally."

"If it wants to broaden its reach to this the SAA code of ethics would have to say that we agree to abide by international laws for doing arachaeology in the country we work in, including obtaining all necessary work permits, visas, and artifact export agreements"

"It could definitely take stronger stands.  I love the fact that some countries will only give permits to archaeologists if they include funding and a plan for either site conservation or a local museum or training. Why not require that of all archaeologists working everywhere, and then work with major funding agencies so they include these activities under what they will fund?  It could work."
"I think there is still a big gap concerning foreign archaeologists in Mexico, and as a student I don't think the ethics principles address the ways in which power and hierarchy continue to be a huge problem."

"By having principles of ethics published/posted, SAA sets a standard. The country in which I work is much more lax and permits derogatory language, for example. We forbade its use within the project, though I am not sure we sensitized our collaborators sufficiently that it stuck with them. By insisting on respectful address among project participants, I believe we at least made a reasonable effort to change how people think of others."
"These ethical guidelines seem to have been generated primarily from concerns of U.S. and European archaeologists. It's not that they are bad or inapplicable to the rest of the world, they just are unaware of specific country issues and do not adequately address the need for western archaeologists to actually respect and engage with parallel archaeological traditions in different countries (either the countries in which they do fieldwork or others that they are completely ignorant of)."

"I agree to a certain extent, with provisions previously indicated. I conduct field and lab research in other countries beyond the US as well, so would like to see some broadening of the ethical statements to include responsible cooperation and collaboration with antiquities organizations, training opportunities for students or local residents in that country, etc.  Too many still operate in a very colonialist mode, which should be discouraged."

The existing principles focus on the concept of dong \"no harm.\" But we also need to address archaeologists responsibility to do 'good\". The great bulk of archaeology today is publicly funded. We not only need to make our research relevant to the public, but must also work to contribute to the public good. We cannot continue merely to address the intellectual interests of archaeologists and a small group of enthusiasts. This is not only for altruistic reasons but for archaeology's survival."

One archaeologist insisted that an arrowhead could have only been used during a certain time period - very finite

I simply pointed out to him that Muscle Cars from the 1960 are still in great shape and can driven just the same in 2018 as they were driven in 1960 - just because its over 60's years old doesn't mean that it can't be used today.

More specifically - If I am a Native and didn't have an arrowhead and needed one, there's a good chance I would have used it to meet my needs - I may have not known or even cared if it was 200 years old."

"None of these adequately deal with US archaeologists working abroad and the obligation they have to the people and places they work."
"(same as prior question) The current SAA Principles of Ethics, while adopted post passage of NAGPRA, appears to be wedded to a pre-NAGPRA mentality that perpetuates the fetishes of the discipline (e.g. the artifact, the site, the report), in isolation from the communities that generated them. When mentioned, these descent communities are placed on par with other interests, rather than acknowledging their unique connection and right of control over the disposition of their ancestors and cultural patrimony."

"Honestly don't see how \"the country\" has anything to do with this. Yes, different countries have different laws and different types of ethical concerns, but those should be covered by these broad statements."

"I run research excavations in the USA and abroad.

"Need more about indigenous peoples of the Americas. Why aren't burials mentioned specifically? Too political in 1996? There should be some discussion of respect for anyone working with human remains."
"- The Principles need to be backed up by the SAA (e.g. help archaeologists engage the public somehow)
- The Principle 9 misses the mark
- How can the Principles be complete if we don't acknowledge that we are a predominantly white scholastic body studying (most often) communities and people of color?
- Archaeologists should be nudged toward meaningful collaborations, not just \"consultation.\" The law handles consultation in many cases, we need to strive to be better."
"I don't actually recall reading anything about compliance with local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations pertaining to permits, operations, safety, reporting of results...for example, there are a fair number of countries, at least in Europe, where there are very strict permitting, data collection, training, education, and reporting requirements. As a specific example, Austrian laws say that only an archaeologist who is registered with the federal government may lead archaeological activities in that country, that all data must be collected in a particular way and submitted using particular electronic formats, and that all final reports must be written in German. This code should let folks know they're on the hook for knowing those and complying."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Again, no duty of care and no consequences. These are not standards, they are guidelines. There are a fair number of archaeologists who do a poor job of following them, or flagrantly disregard them. Since there is no mechanism for compliance, reporting, or enforcement, they are just nice suggestions. That is a legitimate way to approach things, but then the SAA can't pretend to be the voice and representative of responsible archaeology. For instance, why should I take seriously the SAA efforts to lobby the US Congress regarding cultural heritage when the organization can't hold its own members to account in terms of protecting the same resources, not working with looters or looted collections, etc.?"
NA
"Same as before, but here I'll reiterate the need for more attention to Indigenous communities -- I work in the U.S. -- as the groups whose histories have built up the careers of many SAA members and, originally, the very organization itself."

"Do the Principles of Ethics discuss pay for entry level positions? After the economy collapsed in 2008, I saw several \"job advertisements\" from CRM firms looking for \"volunteers.\" If a company is being paid to excavate a site and process the artifacts, they should pay everyone involved a living wage."

"For the most part they are ok, but see previous comments for some issues that are difficult, but do happen.  And, as always, what are the Society's expectations of members to adhere to these principles, and what actions does the Society take when a member violates these principles?  What is the process and the \"penalties\"?  I assume these are in the by-laws, but haven't looked at those lately either.  Sending this questionnaire out from time to time is good in that it is a way to make us remember that we have a code of ethics and we need to read it from time to time."
"Somewhat agree, more often than not the scholarly nature of practitioners in the area where I work surpasses other ethical concerns"
NA
NA
"I think it is a mistake that we do not acknowledge or name the extractive history of archaeology (and colonialism as a broader movement) anywhere in our principles. It would be appropriate to say \"we must acknowledge the harms that have been inflicted in the process of building the field of American archaeology and commit to considering the role our work can have in contemporary peoples' lives\"."

"Nope. Working partnerships with Native communities are not stated (perhaps vaguely hinted at), and sexual harassment is barely addressed. The curation crisis could also be better stated and envisioned. 

Perhaps under each principle, there could be a link to additional resources for that particular topic - websites, podcasts, blogs, articles, etc."
"We now have a statement regarding following laws related to harassment and assault. It would be helpful to have an ethic to follow all applicable laws and regulations in the places we work...including those related to harassment and assault."
NA

"The ethical thinking reflected in the Principles best reflects US academic culture. Other countries have different ethical cultures and other concerns. Additionally, although I think CRM in the US derives from the Academy, different or only partially overlapping ethical concerns arise in it, and the principles though, on the whole, good, do not fully encompass ethics needed for a discipline mixing science and business."
