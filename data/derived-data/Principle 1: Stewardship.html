As currently written, this principle risks losing sight of stakeholders and fetishizing materials. I was particularly reminded of the perils of this perspective a couple of years ago during a debate online about what to do about confederate monuments. One archaeologist, a Classicist, suggested that we had an ethical obligation to make sure that those monuments be preserved in a museum, even if they were taken down. Other anthropological archaeologists in the conversation suggested that we had an almost HIppocratic obligation to avoid doing harm -- and that the statues should be destroyed if they were doing harm. What was lacking in the conversation was a more applied discussion of alternatives to complete preservation and annihilation, involving digital documentation and curation. </td> </tr>

Archaeologists have responsibilities, yes, but are not the appropriate stewards in many situations, nor should they be. "All people" is a moral and philosophical stance with respect to cultural heritage and material culture. In some situations, the appropriate response for a community is to allow degradation (through use or otherwise). Also, sometimes, things should not be seen or accessed by all people.

Also, engaging the reality of the political economy of archaeology in this statement would assist archaeologists to see how the structures in which our professional lives are enmeshed, formed, and limited/enabled, has a huge, huge effect on how we interpret what should or can be preserved. In other words, most archaeologists are failing massively in terms of any kind of complete or capable or competent protection of the archaeological record, depending on how stewardship, protection, and preservation are defined (whether compliance, CRM, academic in origin). 

This aspirational principle, in its current form, is almost not helpful because of the discontinuity with what most of us are trained and paid to do most often (destroy and make limited record of contexts; with limited curation; with severely limited resource base for preservation, conservation, interpretation, access, and interoperability).  If we really took seriously this call,  stewardship would refocus every single person on existing collections and on mitigating through publication collections that result from the ongoing destruction that society deems unavoidable due to needs for nicer houses or less traffic or more electricity, etc. </td> </tr>

Although protecting the archaeological record for "all people" sounds like a nice idea, in practice this type of statement leads into a myriad of ethical quandaries. For example, ideas of national patrimony and world heritage are used to marginalize indigenous people in Mesoamerica and other parts of the world by providing a justification to remove people from their land. Several decades of research have demonstrated that object focused archaeologists will likely not have a bright future because indigenous and descendant communities all over the world are increasingly demanding stewardship over their heritage. Thus, I think we need a first principle that emphasizes a shared responsibility over the archaeological record and some mention of archaeologist conduct in relation to living people.

Principle 1 has a lot of merits but it makes no mention of our responsibilities to collaborate with descendant groups or to avoid harming living people.

Archaeologists have particular expertise and authority that they should use to "promote public understanding...", but they are also stakeholders for whom archaeological material is a resource. I agree that archaeological uses of the record should often take precedent over other uses (e.g., commercialization, destruction by land-owners or for political reasons), but not always, as when archaeological material  is valued as cultural heritage in ways that aren't served by archaeological investitation. </td> </tr>

Descendent communities, who have a greater claim as stakeholders of cultural resources usually have different views from archaeologists of what stewardship looks like, and their wishes should be prioritized more than others. More often than not, the "benefit of all people" hides a colonial mentality, which extracts material resources from their place of origin for the benefit of a very small public, one, if we're being honest, really just benefits the archeologists involved.  Archaeologists can easily manipulate this principle, claiming they alone know what is best for the material record and therefore are better protectors of artifacts sites than the cultures to which they belong.

Indigenous peoples may think of themselves as "caretakers," which is far more robust than "stewards" - my point isn't that archaeologists should be caretakers, too, but that as professionals we need to think of the complex social dynamics and interests at play. 

Likewise, is preserving heritage essential in every cultural context, or does it reflect a specific cultural framework with specific metaphysical anxieties about oblivion? Should statues of confederate generals be preserved, and what kinds of social spaces get opened up as these "heritage" objects and monuments to white supremacy are taken down?

Historically in the US, "stewardship" has meant the appropriation of ancestral Native American bodies and material culture in colonial institutions, so I think this principle needs to be reevaluated and rewritten. </td> </tr>

The overarching "cultural heritage for all' argument discredits Native American knowledge and expertise. Burial sites should not be disturbed.
