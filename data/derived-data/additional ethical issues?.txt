"Living communities; Indigenous intellectual and cultural property rights; digital aspects of care, curation, and access; make them enforceable instead of aspirational, i.e. by working more closely with RPA. I mean, let's be honest, that's really the problem - that they are aspirational, so all we can do is hope that archaeologists take a virtue approach to ethics and see these Principles as ways they can support betterment of humanity by being decent human beings. People who don't follow these principles are still seated at the highest levels of archaeology across sector."

"does not address the issue of attendance at meetings by knows sexual harassers, or by reporters that want to inflame the truth by putting lies on the internet.  Both sides here are in the wrong, and need to be addressed.  The fact that some individuals bring such complaints to a reporter is a symptom of problems within the discipline.  But the public embarrassment route is not a good one.  we need other mechanisms. SAA could provide a body to adjudicate such claims outside of the university environment that would be helpful. Universities are not getting this right."
"Colonial legacies (relationships with Indigenous and other communities)
Harassment, assault, bullying
Labor conditions and issues

"Archaeology as a disciple is reproduced in university training, as well as in fieldwork. The erosion of long-term academic employment (not just tenure, but continuity) deeply affects both undergraduate and graduate education, as well as the ability to direct continuing research. I consider that the SAA needs to develop a position on this issue.

There is no strategic planning to provide training in all aspects of archaeological analysis essential to work with the collections we generate. Instead, jobs and courses emerge in response to market trends in education (eg. bioarchaeologists who can teach premed students, GIS specialists who can teach planners), while important branches of our field lack anyone employed to teach them. The SAA could create a forum to identify these gaps and co-sponsor a graduate seminar in one or another specialty at a participating university, providing at lease temporary employment for a specialist and an opportunity for a cohort of students."

"There is constant concern and discussion throughout the profession regarding proper and respectful treatment of individuals regardless of race, gender, and so on as set fort in Principle #9.

"as archeology has increasingly been weaponized by indigenous communities for their own protection we should think about how we present our work to the public and how it's going to be used and decide as a collective what parameters we need to have in place in order to have our research being responsible used by its descendant populations. this is not to say that we should prevent this but rather we should enable the use of this knowledge by the people whose history it is"
"Yes, I think that they should address more practice and less aspiration. The Principles that seem to be more action/practice oriented are those written or rewritten more recently (for example harassment).

(2) Ethical reeds to better contextualize digital data and respect context while using digital archaeological data;

(4) Governance structures and power issues relating to who controls the technical infrastructure managing archaeological data;

"The SAA should consider that many archaeologists are using false identities online to promote their ideas.  This should not be allowed.  There should be a statement about how archaeologists, and those that publish at the SAA, should engage with the public online.  I think it is problematic that when a member of the public tries to point out unethical behavior that they have observed by archaeologists, the member of the public is usually blocked by the archaeologist.  There seems to be no willingness within the archaeological community to address online behavior by archaeologists  that is harmful."
NA

"I'm not sure that the SAA principles can address this concern. But the SAA membership should support international members call for an increase in governmental repository support of objects and curation through archaeological practices. At the moment, for example there is one state funded warehouse in Guatemala to place archaeological project boxes when efforts are terminated. The good stuff goes to the National Museum. When another project needs space, the contents of the box on the shelf are thrown out in a big hole out back -- this is not unusual practice in other Latin American countries (Nicaragua)."

Of course this applies to many other scientific fields, however the SAA should use this as an opportunity to become a more \"serious\" organization to not only protect the archaeological record itself but also the archaeologists. A code of ethics may not be a set of hard rules but the SAA should strive to develop a code of rules/laws that is non negotiable and that all archaeologists should abide or face the consequences of their actions or lack of actions."

DNA research should be a required element  of human remains study when considering repatriating human remains many hundreds, certainly thousands of years old.  How else are we to untangle issues surrounding the population of the Americas?  Trashing the very resource, the tools of legitimate scientific inquiry by repatriating lacking adequate and complete scientific study (and analysis) to me is a SIGNAL violation of archaeological ethics. 3-D imagery of soon to be repatriated material should be a requirement of NAGPRA materials.

I do feel we need to work toward a true democratization of our knowledge in a way that balances the expectations of an academic discipline. Also, what are our responsibilities with respect to sites being destroyed due to climate change? And on that topic, do we have responsibilities to try to limit the impact of our own work on climate change? For example, do we need to meet as a society every year? How do we (or can we even) limit travel in some capacity? I say this as someone who always really enjoys the SAA meetings, but it's something to consider."

Maybe I'm not the person to bring this up because while I've always been taught that I was to be an advocate for the resource, my paycheck rarely has had a deadline attached to it.  other archaeologists have told me about projects where large sites were investigated with four 1X1 meter units before a pipeline went through. In my early days I was on a survey of a couple of thousand acres with 20% visibility and an average shovel test interval of 1 per acre. (Now I would sue a company that tried that.) I've been on 'surveyed' public lands and found  several, fairly large, lithic scatters. I know the ACHP only requires a good-faith effort during survey, but it seems a chunk of commercial CRM archaeologists are atheists."

"Sexual harassment and assault and Native American/descendant community issues continue to be extremely important. However, most people learn about archaeology, the past, and descendant communities through media, including social media. We need to think more about how to engage diverse media in ways that strengthen the public's understanding of archaeology, archaeologists, and what we study and pushes back against the stereotypes and misconceptions that are being promulgated daily, often for profit, and, sometimes, with archaeologists' implicit or explicit participation."
"Prevention of vandalism and looting. Protections of sites in conflict zones. Combatting irresponsible interpretations of the archeological record, including anti-racism and anti-facism."

"We are also anthropologists. We need to be clear about our role in rooting out structural violence, especially in educational institutions."
NA
"Sexual harassment needs to be explicitly defined and a strongly worded statement condemning sexual harassment must be included. 

I teach a course on ethics and professionalism and I refer my students to the SAA principles (among others), yet the one thing that is missing from the SAA principles is any concrete stance on sexual harassment. This is unbelievable. We need a firm Code of Ethics, not just a list of principles"

Appropriate use and updating of Secretary of Interior standards."

"Private and individuals' collections or various types need and deserve attention."
"I feel like there is probably something missing, but I am not sure what off the top of my head!  Respect and communication could be stressed more throughout. More de-colonial language would be good.

I think the opinions of those archaeologists who are closer to the start of their careers and who may be from diverse racial groups/ethnicities should be prioritized. I am a 47 year old white woman. I think at this stage in the SAA it is more important to hear from younger people from different backgrounds. Not people like me (which is why I am not filling out the form for follow up conversations!)."
"- Diversity is necessary (and currently lacking) and the Principles should loudly support it
- Sexual harassment and assault is rampant and the Principles should loudly denounce it and provide a framework for thriving environments
- No one's archaeology is \"better than.\" Historical archaeology, even when it's a recent history, needs to be taken seriously."

"The most unethical situations I usually find myself dealing with is agencies trying to get by with the minimum level of adequate compliance with archaeological regulations."
"I think most of the relevant ethical issues could be addressed by modifying/enforcing the existing principles along the lines previously discussed. Nothing comes immediately to mind that would require a 10th, separate point."
"See my comments throughout. Traditional knowledges and decolonization. 

And the next question is a forced rank system. Ugh."

"It is difficult to anticipate unique situations that may be faced by archaeologists, but in the previous question I spoke about he ethical responsibility of placing items found in the hands of the historical commissions instead of police or medical examiners offices. This really refers to using one's archaeological knowledge in such a way as to assist with this type of troubleshooting and also intervening when a wrong is seen or experience. In other words taking the initiative to ensure stewardship and brokering that the material gets to the right agency."
