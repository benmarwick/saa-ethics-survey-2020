"A conservator friend restored (from a lot of potsherds) a Woodland ceramic vessel inherited by the daughter of a collector, who said (claimed?) she just want in memory of her dad. I thought maybe she thought she could sell it (doubtful...a bag of sherds), but the SAA had nothing helpful about the ethics of dealing with private collectors. I asked an SAA board member friend, who said board members she spoke to said it was a can of worms. I think this needs to be addressed. Personally, I am pretty hard-line on the subject of getting involved with private collectors, but I do think there is a role for education. For example, a collector could be encouraged to donate their object(s) to an educational institution...even unprovenienced material is exciting for non-archaeologists, and such material would be ok to be handled, as it has little scientific, but a lot of educational value."

This dispute was then found to have genesis with an archaeologist within our state for control of collection. Nasty business..."

"Absent finding anything more useful in the realm of codes of ethics, I cite county, state, and federal laws and best practices to try to convince others (including historical societies) not to publish the locations of archaeological sites online. The SAA Ethics Guide refers to this issue in Principle 6, but its a bit subtle and lost in other issues related to publication within the same principle. 

For the ethical practice of archaeology, I use the principles of Community-Based Participatory Archaeology as outlined by Sonya Atalay (2012) Briefly, it can be stated as 1) the use of a community-based, partnership process 2) that is participatory in all aspects, 3) that builds community capacity, 4) that engages in a spirit of reciprocity and 5) that recognizes the contributions of multiple knowledge systems."
