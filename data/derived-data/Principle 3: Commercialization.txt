"I think we often have failed to adequately address broader ethical issues in the field by overly focusing on the policing of archaeological objects. I do not necessarily think that archaeologists should police people's relationships to artifacts and sites, though agree we should 1) not contribute to their commodification and 2) need to do more to educate people about the nature and value of archaeological knowledge gained from in situ artifacts."
"I would add that our activities should not facilitate access to antiquities or their commercialization."
NA
NA
"In particular, I believe that some colleagues are too willing to too quickly fall in with looters, pot hunters, and metal detector enthusiasts to mine them for information of limited importance and by thereby doing this legitimize their activities. I believe that if a collector wishes to cooperate, they must show their good faith by completing site forms and documenting their past \"digs.\" Then we can sit and talk - but never before. Naturally, archaeologists MUST maintain the high ground by ensuring all of their own excavations are published in some format and made PUBLICLY available."

"This following portion is problematic... \"Archaeologists should therefore carefully weigh the benefits to scholarship of a project against the costs of potentially enhancing the commercial value of archaeological objects.\"  In my opinion, worrying about the market value of objects is the lowest common denominator.  That's neither for whom nor why I labor."
NA
"We have participated with authorities regarding selling of archaeological objects in Buenos Aires. It was a long legal process, but many of the materials could be recovered and given back to Perú and Ecuador, from where they had been looted. The Perú ambassador offered us a recognition with a meeting at the Embassy."

"Archaeology is already deeply commercialized. The profession's public face is a suite of magazines and managed places that elevate the equivalent of \"gold and pretty gems\" (or whole pots or elaborate carved stones or whatever material thing) with precisely nada in way of explaining how the science works or why it matters beyond mere aesthetic appreciation."
NA
"CRM, in particular for-profit archaeological consulting, by its very nature commercializes archaeological objects under the guise of scholarship and legal compliance. Increasingly, it seems that the commercial value of some archaeological sites and objects are increasing well beyond their scholastic or cultural value. Two examples: 1) hundreds to thousands of dollars spent on documenting barely-50-year-old trash concentrations during a single inventory project; 2) tens of thousands of dollars to \"mitigate\" a small sliver of an archaeological site containing one previously documented grinding slick and a few dozen ceramic sherds and flakes (most of which had been previously analyzed)."
NA
NA
NA
"This is woefully inadequate and incomplete.

We take a strong ethical position about the commercialization of objects but say nothing about commercialization of the data, knowledge and intellectual outcomes of our work. 

We recognize there are lots of negative externalities to the commercial exploitation of physical remains. We need to similarly assess the negative externalities of commercializing archaeological intellectual property. The ethical problems of draconian copyright laws and the intrusive surveillance of commercial digital publishing platforms (not to mention social media platforms) get very little attention and discussion in the SAA.

These are big problems. If we are serious about making archaeology more inclusive and democratic, then we need to consider the ethics of how we communicate archaeology. 
"
"I don't disagree with the statement, but it is insufficient.  It couches cultural materials solely in a very limited archaeological value.  More should be said here about the partnership between archaeologists as stewards for the preservation of culture (not just materials) and respect for past and present peoples."
NA
"A statement needs to be added here about trying to return objects that were stolen in the past to their rightful owners.  The situation of the Parthenon Marbles, as well as the Haida totem poles in the British Museum come to mind."
NA

"It is legal to have personal collections in international countries following their respective laws (e.g. registered collections). Those should be able to have a place in research in SAA journals, symposia, and discussion groups."

"While I still strongly agree with this, I would add that it sometimes puts collections managers in a pickle when dealing with insurance estimates (especially for artifact loans) or donations (the value of the donation). I wish there was some guidance to assist with these challenging cases when an insurance company or a donor needs a value for legal purposes."
NA
NA
"There is a tension zone in this principle involving educating the public -- how do we teach about the research value of context without engaging collectors about the materials they have collected -- yet any information about an item that preserves context and association also \"authenticates\" and raises the commercial value."
NA
"This needs to be more strongly stated.  \"Whenever possible...\" isn't good enough.  I supposed that this opens the door to the question of enforcement, but I believe it's important that the statement of ethics recognize activities that are so damaging to the practice of archaeology that they will not be tolerated."
NA
NA
"I don't think that it is worded strongly enough - rather than saying we professional archaeologists should \"avoid, activities that enhance ...\" should probably be something like \"should never take part in activities ...\" or something along those lines --- and the part about \"weigh the benefits ... against costs ...\" makes it sound like there are situations where, if the archaeologist deems the benefit is great enough, could sell artifacts"

But my personal experiences with individuals who do this, and never-ending attempts at education and public outreach, indicate that these behaviors will never stop. It is therefore important that we do not turn a blind eye toward significant finds made the individuals who indulge in these behaviors because of our concern over enabling them and increasing the potential monetary value of their finds."

"I agree that we should do what we can to deter the commercial exploitation and trade in antiquities. Yet as a finite and unique resource, there will be times when it is necessary to record and study materials that may be in private collections."
"As long as private land in this country gives property owners freedom to do as they wish with heritage resources, it matters very little what the small archaeological community thinks about commercialization. We should be working to change the laws, state by state if we have to."
NA

"There needs to be clear and meaningful consequences for violating these ethical principles."
NA
"Although I agree with this statement, it includes so many gray areas that I feel it is not easily applicable in most situations involving the public. Though we have worked on it for many years, we have not been successful at convincing the public who love the study of history and prehistory as much as we do that they shouldn't own something that brings them joy. Even if they didn't dig it up themselves but bought it at a gallery or auction house, or inherited it. 

I think it is important for archaeologists to recognize that the public will support what they do only if they feel like it benefits them, and that it enhances their appreciation of the past. This can, and should, include approaches as simple as celebrating an artifact solely for its beauty, regardless of any scientific contribution it might make."

"\"Whenever possible\" creates a loophole. If an archaeologist already possesses dubious ethical standards, this language creates opportunities to justify obviously unethical behaviors and practices."
"I think the archaeological community can also take a more active role in encouraging the return of objects of cultural patrimony (or control over how those objects are displayed, interpreted, and essentially commercialized) to descendant communities whenever possible."
NA
"This needs to be tweaked. I agree that commercialization is a problem. But everything we publish, talk about in public presentations, etc. arguably enhances commercial value. Even if I told someone an artifact was \"rare\", its value could be increased. Maybe a partial list of things that are OK, even through they may enhance value."

"In the era of social media and sensationalized TV shows involving \"archaeology,\" the focus of this principle might be reframed.

"This is a difficult issue that, ultimately, each practitioner must probably resolve for herself many times over the course of a career. I like the way this principle is stated: \"Archaeologists should . . . carefully weigh . . .\" A dogmatic, one-size-fits-all statement would not work here."
NA
NA
NA

NA
"If anything this statement should be stronger, getting away from waffling words like \"whenever possible\" and stating explicitly that archaeologists shall not engage in projects that result in objects being sold, given to investors, or otherwise disappearing into private collections.
"
"The value of archaeological objects is enhanced by context.  The archaeologist necessarily increases commercial value by research, analysis and reporting."
"I like the principle but I some people overly judgmental in its application at times. Some areas/topics require heavy use of museum collections/private collections that were not gained in accordance with currently accepted field work (e.g., Mimbres pottery). Overly zealous individuals at times seem to advocate ignoring any artifacts collected before 1950, donated to museum, or in private collections. That seems unreasonable to me, and IS NOT required by the ethical statement."
NA
"The only way to actually support the position as articulated is to stand in opposition to private, free-market capitalism.  I'm not a Maxist, I'm not a communist, and I'm not opposed to \"commercialization.\"  Removal of objects from the archaeological record for multiple purposes is obviously as old as the record itself.  A Middle Archaic forager that dug a roasting pit through an intact Paleoindian midden \"destroyed\" part of the record just as assuredly as a backhoe trenching out a sewer line.  The fact that one was part of a capitalist endeavor is irrelevant."

"\"The commercialization of archaeological objects - their use as commodities to be exploited for personal enjoyment or profit - **  results in the destruction of ...\"   Does ** need a 'may' ?

"Museums often hold \"Artifact ID Days\" which bump up against this principle, guidance on this from the SAA might be helpful."
NA

"This needs to be re-written and clarified. Archaeologists should simply not engage in any commercial activity. In addition, the SAA should work to develop a supplemental document for best practices involving research using private collections."
NA
"Seems a basic essential for protecting resources"
NA
"This is a very difficulty area in some settings. In many cases collectors have already \"controlled\" the availability of certain classes of objects. One example that comes to mind is the Hopewell effigy or platform pipe. The great majority were excavated many years ago. Similarly Mississippian human head effigies. I would assume that similar situations apply in Latin and South America. Probably 80+ percent of the objects are in private hands. It is probably not too far off the mark to say that many pre-columbian \"high art\" objects are not in public settings. These objects often played significant roles in the pre-columbian communities and their careful study and documentation provides a significant insight. In many cases their exposure to modern descendant communities can provide valuable insights to the communities past. Yet, to study these clearly increases their commercial value. I have no easy solution to this corundum. I would suggest rewriting the last sentence to say something like

 Whenever possible they should carefully assess the information, scientific and descendant community benefits  that any analysis would generate and only in those cases where such benefits clearly are significant should proceed, otherwise they should discourage, and should themselves avoid, activities that enhance the commercial value of archaeological objects, especially objects that are not curated in public institutions, or readily available for scientific study, public interpretation, and display."

NA
NA
NA
NA
"This one seems kind of weak. People should \"carefully weigh\" and \"wherever possible\" avoid things. When is it impossible to avoid commercializing the archaeological record? Why not just say, \"don't do it.\""
"I agree with this principle, but I also think that it should actively encourage collaboration with law enforcement to stem the illicit trade.  In my experience, some archaeologists have been reluctant to so engage, as they believe that such participation supports the monetary value of archaeological materials assigned by looters and others."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I don't really understand what this means.  I agree with the overall concept that buying and selling of objects is bad.  I'm not sure how I personally could enhance the commercial value of objects.  Can we change the language?"

"We should not work with collectors period. If you have a question about this talk to the tribes and what they see done by these people."
NA
"Two centuries of looting and avocational excavations have produce a large number of archaeologically important materials. to simply ignore the potential information in these is professionally unsound.  The scientific treatment of these artifacts may enhance their value, thus ensuring their preservation in the very large and active collector market.  I happen to work with rare stone figures - of the several dozen known only two have been recovered in the last half century in archaeological context.  To ignore the other specimens is a failure to fulfill our ethical responsibility to the people who made them and to the profession."
"Best we can say without being hard-liners in either direction."
NA
"Looting is clearly bad; but this forces a neoliberal, positivist-oriented praxis down the throats of communities that are going to have virtually no interest in our research other than how they will be materially helped. Who are we to say that OUR use of someone else's history is more justified than people looting as a means of subsistence? How neocolonial.  Rather we have to recognize that looting is an unfortunate symptom of a broader systemic, economic, and political failure to provide a viable means of living to a great number of marginalized people."

"I am sympathetic with this hard line and abide by it, but now feel it has largely failed across the globe.  Can not the SAA consider a range of other stances, based on examples that combine stewardship with a recognition of other human impulses?  I'm thinking of examples from the UK ('treasure'; redundant coinage, etc), Peru (Sipan stewardship and local involvement incentives)...The vast trove of someday soon to be explored underwater sites and wrecks comes to mind.  We need some compromises there with the other stakeholders or we will lose much more than we save."

"This is phrased too loosely. The term \"Whenever possible\" should be removed."
"Still works for me.   This doesn't mean that archaeologists shouldn't find supportive, positive ways to work with collectors."
NA
NA
"Commercialization of antiquities is prevalent particularly with e-commerce availability. Professionals should be encouraged to actively discourage placing a \"valuation\" on objects and artifacts."
"I've always thought that commodification (rather than commercialization) would be a better word to be use here."
NA
NA
NA
"A common argument about/against archaeologists and the work we do that I've encountered often, especially in the federal sector, is that we berate most folks for looting and vandalizing, while we ourselves will collect artifacts and store them away, never to be seen again in many cases-- and, honestly, I think that's valid. I think we should consider updating our values to reflect the shift towards keeping things in situ when/where possible. Museums are not the \"holy grail\" anymore, nor should they be, for all premodern cultural materials."
NA
NA
NA
"I have seen much progress here, but I believe with Principle 3 that there is much work to do.  I still see too much site looting where archaeologists look the other way, too much emphasis on collecting artifacts that have museum display value, and too little emphasis on scientific studies of artifacts."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Commercialization is a concern but it is not nearly as large an issue as some of the other principles. In fact, sometimes commercialization is a necessary part of protecting an archaeological resource in that convincing governments of the commercial value of resources can make them part of an economic development plan rather than something that stands in the way of development."
NA
"This statement specifically alienates private collectors, who could in many cases agree with the principles but are shunned because 1) they are not a professional archaeologist and 2) have collected artifacts for a variety of preservation and protection reasons"
NA
"Right again! But I only know a small handful of archaeologists who have ever, for example, worked with US Border and Customs control or the FBI to actually STOP trafficking.  There are a few exemplary non-profits now who also do great work  (The Antiquities Coalition, Blue Shield International; then for Cambodia we have Heritage Watch, and I hope other countries have similar small but important NGO's): but these aren't generally run by archaeologists.

We don't get credit for this either."
"I feel that this doesn't get to the root of why looting and selling occurs."

"I'm unsure how archaeologists are supposed to determine whether their projects will enhance the commercial value of archaeological objects. I agree with the sentiment, but I'm not sure how it would/should be put into practice."
"This is better and more nuanced than I remembered. A lawyer could say that archaeologists get personal profit and enjoyment from the materials they excavate. One could argue that any archaeology contributes to the value of looted or non-provenienced artifacts. Archaeologist should not engage in selling or buying excavated material with or without provenience unless it has been deaccessioned appropriately. Personally I would not want to buy any such deaccessioned object but I can't argue strongly against it. 

I think this says we should weigh the value of the work against the potential to increase looting. In Latin and South America especially it is too late. Any continuing work will increase the value of at least some objects. Shall we stop all archaeology in these places.

I guess I think that while it tries to address these questions it is aspirational and does not really give a scholar much guidance.

"
"I think commercialization is bad, but withholding information about how important/interesting/cool an object is not a good way to combat it. If an object is so valuable, we should try to protect it in a way besides concealing how valuable it is. I think knowledge and appreciation gained from such objects should always be promoted."
"Archaeological materials often garner considerable attention, and subsequently market value, The practice of selling artifacts enhances this process and undermines the conservation element."
NA
"As worded this could be taken to rule out working with amateurs and collectors.  In some cases, they have all the material available from a site and if it isn't documented a big chunk of the descendant community's heritage may be lost.  It has to be done carefully and in collaboration with the descendant community."
NA
NA
NA
"However, it must be noted that there is a legal requirement under the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (ARPA) and the ARPA Uniform Regulations for archaeologists to determine the commercial value of archaeological resources which have been the subject of unauthorized removal from federal or Indian lands in the course of violations of this act. This provision was included in ARPA to combat the unauthorized trafficking of archaeological resources. These commercial value determinations are required for the purpose of enforcing ARPA and should be kept confidential except for their use within in the context of the legal system. It also should be noted that some states have adopted the ARPA measures of harm, including commercial value, as determinations of the degree of damage in their state statutes protecting archaeological resources."
"This principle does not go far enough to discourage this kind of activity. These principles are just words and no one is sworn to abide by them, e.g., there is no consequence for not following these principles. Expulsion from SAA is not an outcome and even if it were, it carries no weight. Dont get me wrong, these principles are absolutely, but do not believe they are doing anything more than covering SAAs ass in case liability or litigation against it occurs."
"The greatest difficulty with this principle is that one does not always know an archaeological object has a commercial value."
"Is there a reason this principle doesn't flat out state that commercialization of archaeological objects should NOT be undertaken by members of the society?"
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"This statement could be more explicit.  \"carefully weigh\" is open to interpretation."
"I believe this principle is being applied for the most part, but I still actively see people concentrating on objects, and not necessarily on their interpretation within the record from which they were recovered, nor their care after the report is finished.  If we took better care of our collections and funded the institutions caring for the objects and documentation, we could do more comprehensive research and provide better public interpretative exhibits."
NA
"I agree with the ideas and sentiments in this principle, but the reality is that the commercial market is out of our control. I have long had to deal with this due to the location of much of my research. My own approach is to let the dealers know that I oppose their activities and I explain why in as much detail as possible. But I still try to treat them in a civil manner and encourage them to share information. In most cases, this has resulted in saving information that otherwise would have been lost forever. I periodically send this information to relevant site files or other repositories to ensure that the information is part of the official record. I don't know if the wording of the principle could be altered to incorporate this aspect, but I consider it a facet of public archaeology that is a sort of last-ditch effort to save as much archaeological information as possible. So many times, once the original finder or dealer sells the item, all of the original provenience information is lost. If it changes hands several times over the years, all it takes is one temporary owner to discard all of the associated information and it is gone forever. Even worse is when one of these people attributes the item to a different site to increase its value. I am dealing with a situation of this type at present. So I think there should be some encouragement to try and salvage any information possible. Perhaps it doesn't belong in these principles--I'll let the committee decide that."

"I believe that most archaeologists are very cognizant of this and do their best to thwart such activities. However, in some instances archaeologists are often a small part of a much larger project and may not have the influence, and certainly the authority, to keep such activities from happening. I believe, however, that most archaeologists are ethical about this and try to do what they can to keep it from happening."
NA
"Here especially the principle should emphasize the need to balance the needs and desires of local communities, including descendant communities, landowners, and legally compliant artifact collectors.

Archaeologists must recognize, and codes of ethics must reflect that archaeological ethics are not the only ones that matter.  Best practice requires recognition of and mediation among all local communities impacted by the work we do; not just the ones an individual archaeologist happens to prioritize."
"Should add statement that buying and selling also contributes to disproportionately commodifying cultural heritage, including sacred objects, from disenfranchised and indigenous groups."
NA
NA
NA
"This is a difficult one but I think it strikes a good balance"
NA
"Just the fact of putting out more knowledge about artifacts can often make them more valuable to collectors, so while I agree we should minimize this, I don't think that should dilute our interpretations and dissemination of what we find because that is also an ethical responsibility."
NA

"Would be nice for the SAA to highlight this with rules or suggestions for how archaeologists can follow it. For example, I get asked a lot by the general public to identify a specific artifact type from a photo. I don't do this, because without any other evidence I have to assume that person is planning to sell it. I've had other archaeologists ask me to provide more information on an artifact or cultural object that a friend brought back (generally from Europe, since that's my speciality, whereas many American archaeologists focus on material culture in the US)."

"I do feel this is one area where we apply an ethical standard to objects that extends well beyond any legal standards (appropriately) while relying on legal standards towards people (both in terms of harassment and in terms of 106 and such).
I also think some archaeologists blur these lines and work to gain access to collections for their research without consideration of promoting stewardship and almost granting a \"seal of authenticity\" to collections."

"But archaeologists also have an ethical obligation to be good stewards of the archaeological record, including collections, which sometimes requires us to purchase objects or collections for disposition in a public or not-for-profit repository to ensure they're not lost or destroyed.

"The difficulty of actualizing this principle is reflected in the myriad strategies used by my colleagues. Often they will lambast those whose research utilizes looted objects--whether in public institutions [outside the commercial market] or in private hands [sometimes the source of their research funds]. Yet they ask for, and utilize, the research results of these same colleagues. Or they sidestep the issue by not publishing a photograph of the looted object but instead offer a simple drawing of the object or only a portion thereof, and they don't reveal the source/location of the object. This impedes scholarship and shields those involved in the marketing of cultural property."

Archaeological research has rarely contributed in significant ways to enhance the commercial value of archaeological objects, which is mostly determined by market economics. In fact, in the majority of situations, archaeological research has lagged far behind the antiquities market, that is, the objects acquire value independently as a result of looting and illegal marketing, while archaeological research arrives late in the scene only after looting and marketing have taken place."

"As a former museum director, I do not believe this reflects reality or recognize the needs of long-term curation.  People are going to collect, whether it is rocks, stamps, and Indian relics.  We need to recognize and respect the distinction between those collectors who are responsible (i.e. practice stewardship, share their data, and work with professional) versus those who are not (those whose primary interest in financial gain).  

Additionally, I would add that the sale of archaeological material can be done in an ethical manner.  An example is unprovenienced objects.  Why not sell an arrowhead to a interested person for a couple dollars, or a object of greater value, but not within the mandate of the institution's mission statement on Ebay?  The real issue is where those funds go.  The ethical answer is to support the preservation, care, and educational use of the core collections."

"ARPA requires, where possible, the determination of Commercial Value defined in the Act as the \"fair market value\" of the objects (in the condition prior to the commission of the prohibited acts). The tribes with whom I routinely work understand this, although they find it alien and insulting. But where human remains and other \"NAGPRA items\" are concerned it reaches another level. Placing a commercial value on human remains should be avoided at all costs. I have sought and obtained letters of support for this which I include in Damage Assessment documents where appropriate. Perhaps some specific language regarding the higher level of concern for human remains and other items as defined by NAGPRA would be beneficial to this statement."

"There is no question that I agree with this principle, but on several occasions I have been asked by collectors to look at objects with their goal of my informally validating \"authenticity.\" These identification activities have occasionally revealed that what they have inherited or purchased are actually clever forgeries. In two cases, my assessments have actually stopped the individuals from participating further in the antiquities trade because it demonstrated both their lack of judgment and the lack ethics on the part of the sellers. This is where, as a contract archaeologist in a museum setting, there is a public obligation to educate, while adhering strictly to the museum policy that prevents formal authentication or valuation."

"This needs to be made much stronger in terms of condemning the use of commercially-available materials for study. Compare the AIA statements about this to upgrade the strength of this language. But be aware that in North America especially, there should be a provision for allowing for the study of an elderly person's arrowhead collection -- perhaps something about keeping in mind the time and place of the collection would be important: that arrowhead collection from the 1950s and picked up in a farmer's own fields is not the same as looted materials coming from conflict zones."
"With the proliferation of digital recording and 3d modeling, we also need to consider the implications of who owns that record of the past and who has access to it, and who has the rights to make those decisions. Unfortunately, most archaeologists publish their models on commercial web sites, who can then sell the object/scene of they choose. This is true both for the hosting companies and the archaeologists. Perhaps the most egregious example of something similar is the company Bone Clones and James Chatters owning the copyright of the Kenewick Man cranium, which they claim is an artistic reconstruction."

For example I came across any amount of bone pins excavating in Ireland. So many people would appreciate having or seeing these for their enjoyment and given there abundance I see little harm or need to store hundreds of thousands of them in storage. This is the legislation in Ireland so everything belongs to the state from its discovery.

Ways of promoting the local economy-- more than just the temporary hiring daily workers, but things like providing job training opportunities, tutoring school children, donating to local non-profits, providing English classes, etc.) should be thought of as a means of mitigating the destructive nature inherent in archaeology. This will help steer community members away from looking to looting as a source of income. Also, archaeologists should be encouraged to giving talks in the local language about the danger that looting represents to the community.  I don't think it happens much any more, but archaeologists have a history of buying sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony  by applying various kinds of duress, particularly to impoverished communities.

This makes us ill equipped to do certain aspects of our job, like determine insurance value for objects being loaned or transported, develop appropriate collections management policies that comply with museum practices, etc. We can say we're against buying and selling things, while also recognize that the people that do that have knowledge that is important to harness and that knowing the value of something can be essential for some professional archaeologists."

"I agree in principle, but basic human nature will always place value on \"stuff\". There is a balancing act between disseminating results and creating interest with the public and enhancing commercial value."
"The first half of this statement and the latter half do not jive for me. Archaeologists should be discouraging the buying and selling of objects, but the focus on the latter half is contributing to the creation of value.  If our work is seen by the public, it will potentially result in value increasing.  That should be combated with statements against looting/selling, not by making the project silent or not doing the project in the first place.  If publicizing that there is archaeological sites in Brazil rainforest creates a market for Brazil artifacts or people seeking sites there, that is bad. But new areas of exploration should not be avoided simply because it can create or increase a market. Those are not 1:1 issues.  I would rather the latter half of this statement discuss if and how archaeologists should combat this, not weighing if their work can be exploited by looters."

"In Texas, professional archeologist must reach out to artifact collectors to try and find ways to stem the tide of \"Pay to Dig\" sites. The crisis is Texas is that there are increasing numbers of \"Pay to Dig\" sites where backhoes are used to dig up deposits so people can screen them and take home the artifacts. Most people who participate are good people who simply enjoy the thrill of finding arrowheads. Most of them want to learn more about what they are finding, and they have no idea that what they are doing is destroying the very information that they wish to learn. Many of them could (and have) become avocational archeologists if they were exposed to better information and opportunities to do \"real archeology.\""

"I think we need to go beyond objects and sites to how those objects, sites, and even our own research is now used by various media (TV shows, magazines, online videos and podcasts, websites, etc.) to promote archaeology in ways that likely increase looting and the value of artifacts as well as misinformation. Archaeology has become very commercialized outside of our organizations like SAA and is actively being used to generate profit for media companies and individuals, sometimes with archaeologists' active engagement."

"I would note that there is a challenge to acting on this principle in that it is often the case that important sites/collections are found and owned by private individuals.  Such sites and collections can include important archaeological information that, if not researched, will be lost to the profession.  It is true that by doing such research archaeologists may provide information that \"enhances the commercial value\" of a collection.  However, since the development of the ethics principles in 1996, the internet has created and sustained a large commercial marketplace, so it's not necessarily the case that archaeological research contributes to the enhancement of commercial value.  I believe that our challenge is to adhere to Principle 1, Stewardship, while doing our best to inform private individuals about what we see as the importance of sharing information about their objects with the profession and the public, while not contributing to the commercialization of archaeological objects or sites.  Discussions with these individuals about donating their collections and records to public repositories can produce the desired outcome.  However, for some parts of the archaeological record in North America, amateurs/private citizens find and hold the lion's share of sites and objects.  To ignore this is, in my opinion, short-sighted and impoverishes our knowledge of the past.  I would prefer to see this principle rewritten to take a more nuanced stance on working with privately-held collections while retaining the language about not inadvertently contributing to the commercialization of archaeological objects."

"All archaeologists should be completely against any manner, or practice that commercializes the archaeological record!

"As it currently reads, I feel it only discusses that the archaeologist should not do anything to promote commercialization. There could be more teeth to the idea that an archaeologist should do everything they can to educate the public about the issues with selling artifacts and the like. A little more accountability for fighting against the selling of the archaeological record would be good too."

"Un problema de Estados Unidos  es la falta de presion publica sobre la ONU para evitar el trafico ilegal de piezas arqueologicas que son vendidas en subastas en Europa en casas de antigüedades.  Estas subastas aceleran la comercialización de bienes patrimoniales que incentivan los huaqueos o las excavaciones clandestinas de personas comunes que no son arqueologos, este caso pasa en Peru. Otro problema es que la SAA debe presionar al ministerio de Cultura de Peru y otros estados Americanos a forjar proyectos museograficos de sitios a investigar. Asi todo lo encontrado ira directamente a un museo y no a almacenes donde pueden ser robados"

More generally, members of the art collecting and museum world continue to defend looting in various mediums, including newspaper editorials, interviews, etc. Those who defend or allowed or enable looting should be shunned from archaeology.

"The focus and approach, including phrasing of issues, in Principle 3: Commercialization are way out of date. While the commercialization and exploitation of archaeological objects is a problem, as is their destruction willful or otherwise, this needs to not just replace commercial value with archaeological scientific value. It needs to consider the importance of not only the objects but the treatment of these materials to the communities from which they arrive, especially descendant communities, cultures, or nations--put the cultural and heritage value back in it."

"I agree that it adequately applies to ethical challenges today, I am often disappointed with the vilification of collectors and other lay people interested in the field by archaeologists and students.

"I'm not sure how any professional archaeological activity would enhance the sale of items?  And frankly, most of the items that have the most monetary \"value\" are those associated with burial context which are either \"whole\" or \"ritual.\"  I think instead archaeologists need to focus on working WITH descendent communities to get to public the message WHY those resources should stay in situ.  And determine which items of \"high monetary value\" are currently on display in museums that should be considered for repatriation under NAGPRA, but are being held onto by museums because of the \"object value,\" rather than \"research value\" attached to it. Further archaeologists should work to educate the public at large on why the artifact alone is lacking in significance to reduce the number of \"buyers\" an item may have, and partner WITH avocational archaeologists to teach them the value of research and data collection to at least diminish the destruction of that info and for them to act as educator advocates to others who may sell artifacts."

"I feel language can be stronger. Affiliation with terrorist groups and the law enforcement component is so important. So many advances have been made in archaeologists working with law enforcement, training in what to look for, long term participation in investigations that uncover small and large scale operations. \"carefully weigh\" changed to stronger language- don't do it, don't be part of it, don't encourage it. Essential to many of the television programs that archaeologists involved are not allowed or encouraged to participate as it violates their professional code of ethics."

"This is an important statement - but is something I was never taught in my studies of archaeology, from BA to MA to PHD.  I have never heard a colleague talk about a time when they did this (chose not to do a project because of commercial impact). I have heard many more stories, both in the US and abroad, where armed guards were hired to protect sites because of valuable objects (or rumors of valuable objects).  

While I agree with the statement, I am struggling with it, because it is something that I do not see practiced or discussed in the field.  How can the SAA, as the national organization, do more to support this ethical aspiration?"
