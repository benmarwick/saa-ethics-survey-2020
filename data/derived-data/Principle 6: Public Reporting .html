Archaeology is lagging behind many other scientific fields in this regard, and it can be unreasonably difficult to get archaeologists to share data that they have used in publications. 

For example, I have requested lab numbers (and other basic information) for radiocarbon dates presented in publications within the last 10 years, and have had multiple authors refuse to provide them. If radiocarbon dates are used in publications, they should be open for scrutiny by any archaeologist who wishes to see them. A request should not even be necessary, they should be digitally available. If archaeologists do not want to share data, then they should not publish with it.

Archaeologists are also increasingly relying on self-written computer code for statistical analyses. This should ALWAYS be made available (they are simply text files, there is little to no reason that they cannot be hosted somewhere online), but this is, unfortunately, not always the case. Effort should also be made to make this code legible. </td> </tr>

Community engagement is a better strategy in an age when people (rightfully) demand access to the data their tax dollars paid for.

This individual has continued to treat the excavation records as personal property even after more than 50 years.  Not only has he been unable to complete a report, he has refused yo make the information available to other scholars as well as the federally recognized tribe (Onondaga Iroquois).  His current plan is to bequeath these records to his alma mater (University of Michigan) rather than a responsible institution in New York, such as the New York State Museum.

The emphasis on "publication" caters to academics, which are not the majority of the archaeologists out there now. Most CRM and gov't archaeologists don't publish since there are no business incentives to do so.

It needs to be explicit that the research can be of either sites or collections!  

The 2nd sentence is problematic.  Suggest something like "The associated records -- documents and analytical materials on which all forms of public reporting are based--, should be curated in a repository or archive for permanent safekeeping according to applicable laws, regulations, or policies." 

The last sentence is fine for sites.  However, there needs to be an additional, similar sentence that all publications and public reporting should identify the repository where the collection is curated for future access and use. It could say something like: "An interest in preserving and enabling future access to archaeological collections must be taken into account by identifying the repository where the collection, whether objects and associated records or associated records only, are curated in all forms of public reporting." </td> </tr>

But the alternative is reproducing colonial relations in which Indigenous materials are unilaterally claimed as national heritage. Of course, many tribes have excellent museums and preservation capacities, and many might prefer objects to be kept in a university or museum with those capacities, but I think these are issues that the SAA needs to tackle head on. </td> </tr>

We are ACTIVELY DISCOURAGED from writing for public audiences, having archaeology blogs, writing op-eds, etc. or disseminating knowledge to the general public in any meaningful way. To me, this principle needs to be broadened and be explicit that it is not good enough to only report and publish in the echo chamber that is academia. We should not only be writing for ourselves. </td> </tr>
