"This code of ethics it doesn't really do much to help the private CRM industry in the United States especially in the West and has nothing specifying work behavior in that field which is very different from academic work.

(1) Address economic inequality, precarious labor conditions, and over work.
(2) Address ntellectual property (esp. commercial commoditization of knowledge). The main ethical discussion about IP centers on indigenous cultural heritage. While that's important, ethical considerations touch on other issues and dimensions. Privacy, normative commercial publishing, needs to better contextualize digital data, inclusive governance structures for digital data, and other topics need more attention and ethical guidance.

While the code mostly encompasses our \"in archaeology house\" issues, it doesn't do a lot to provide guidance on how we should be interacting with other specialists or within the federal framework. That said, it's complicated, and this is likely not the best place for elaboration on those principles."

"Same as before. These principles need to be stronger, no matter the context. In my case, as a tribal liaison, I must hold myself up to standards far beyond what the SAA currently holds. The SAA standards actually and actively make my job harder because of how weak they are. We will never improve our relationship with indigenous people if we don't take a firmer stance on many of these issues."
NA
NA

"Principles of Ethics do not adequately or specifically address bioarchaeology and other archaeological work involving human remains."

"Now that I think about it, was there any language regarding human bones? Perhaps the SAA could link to other related orgs' ethical guidelines, such as the AAPA, AIA, SHA, RPA, etc."
"I work primarily with museum collections and I feel as though my work is often considered tertiary to fieldwork. The direct ethical dilemmas of museum work related to indigenous claims, return, repatriation, standards of care--are only mentioned in passing."
NA

"I worked in government archaeology for almost 40 years and some government archaeologists did not think the ethics and principles applied to them. Some had years of prior field research that was never published."

"As stated previously, I am held to a much higher standard for harassment (sexual and otherwise) which includes a chain of people to report to, an investigation process, and a series of possible resolutions/punishments at my CRM firm (and my previous public agency) than that of Principle 9.

"As a retired Bureau of Land Management archaeologist, I'm concerned by the effects of recent events like the reorganization of the BLM and the removal of the central office and cultural resource program leaders from Washington, D.C.  It would be great if the ethical principles could somehow incorporate more emphasis on the shared public \"ownership\" of cultural resources, based on the many existing laws that recognize their scientific, historical, cultural, and educational values.  I always prefer a values-based approach.  Our public lands resources are threatened as never before."

"IN Southeast Asia, the region where I work, in the field of historical archaeology, it is necessary to work with commercial interests and collectors. Governments lack the will or capacity to protect archaeological sites. Unless data from collectors is incorporated into archaeological research, many important sites and objects will never be recorded. Rather than completely excluding collectors, a code of conduct should be created in which (a) archaeologists would be forbidden to benefit financially from collaborating with collectors, and (b) individuals should be given incentives to report accidental finds to archaeological authorities, in the form of certification of the contexts of artifacts. Rather than claiming exclusive rights to ownership of artifacts found accidentally, the state should be required to allow finders to sell their finds to whomever they choose, as long as the finds are first reported to the archaeological authorities, and the state is given the right of first refusal to acquire them at a stipulated price. The alternative, confiscation without compensation, provides no incentive for finders to cooperate with authorities; quite the opposite situation occurs, in which finders will never report accidental finds."

"In government regulation, policy, and compliance this Code does not really address at all the responsibility of the CRM practitioner has for stakeholders, tribal groups, etc. That's a very tricky issue because obviously the CRM practitioner also has legal responsibilities to their client. But I think there's a minimum care that all archaeologists should provide to descendant communities. And I think we should shift the discipline so that archaeologists ensuring adequate consideration for descendants is seen as integral risk mitigation for their client and as part of best practices. SAA membership should work for changes to state laws in this regard too."

"Not sure a short list principles could, would, or should ever \"adequately\" address all the ethical concerns in every \"sector.\" RPA code and standards addresses a lot of specific ethical concerns in my sector (CRM) that wouldn't necessarily apply broadly to all SAA stakeholders (like \"responsibilities to clients.\")."

"There's more to museums than Item 7 (and bits of others), especially in this demographic moment when boomers are dying off and post-boomers don't want grandpa's arrowheads.  The 40-year-old curation \"crisis\" remains unresolved (although some states have stepped up).  And the place of North American archaeology in museums?  With Natural History (as it is in many institutions) or with History?  Etc."

"Archaeology texts for undergraduates are doing a better job of including women in prehistory and in the profession, but we have done a dismal job of attracting minorities to our profession. Indeed, many groups look upon us with disapproval or suspicion. Also, we have not done a good job of engaging with some of our colleagues in the museum world about the ethics of collection acquisitions and consultations."

"In academia there might also be issues with professors publishing research done by their students... Not sure it makes sense to make very specific guidelines that are only applicable to those working in one sector."
"I'm a government employee (Public Archaeologist, State of Utah).  I need to be able to show stakeholder communities that I engage with where my ethics lie, and trotting out these principles would not persuade anyone to think I'm on their side."

"Much of the archaeological work that I have done has been within the forensic domain in the recovery of human remains and associated evidence. In this domain, there are no real safeguards protecting archaeological heritage and it is up to those who occupy these jobs (forensic anthropologist/archaeologist) to work with local and state historical commissions to ensure that materials are transferred to the proper person if they have prehistoric or historic value. This type of material can fall through the cracks and get stored or discarded if people are not paying attention."
"I think I've mentioned elsewhere the need for decolonization of the archaeological process - it seems like an ambiguous issue but I hope we can prioritize that going forward."

"I work in an \"alternative academic\" job setting and the principles before now have seemed to assume a lot about what we do with our time. Many of us do not run projects or have students in the formal sense but would still like to be guided by our professional community's values."
"CRM, heritage management generally and conservation are only lightly/laterally included.

"Some of the Principles are not relevant to CRM archaeology, especially at the field technician level"
NA
"There does need to be a greater emphasis on what comes after fieldwork. Collections management, artifact rehousing, working with legacy data, and converting early digital media into useable forms (the archaeology of our archaeology, if you will)."

"As a person who has worked in both university, agency, and CRM settings, some of the principals are not practical. For instance, if tin can fragments or rock shatter is collected from a site, does that need to be curated in-perpetuity? Should we be recording post-1950 trash scatters alongside a well-traveled road in the US?"

"I work in climate change, and the gaps in how the field has, and particularly has not, addressed its responsibilities in communication and research are blazingly apparent. I also have experienced challenges from gender-based harassment - existing ethical frameworks were inadequate to protect or address these challenges."
