"Simply put, they are outdated, incomplete, and do not center people. We look at people's objects. Without people - both of the past and in the present to look at  it - archaeology doesn't exist. We need people in ethics and people, overall, are missing from these Principles."

"We must take advantage of all opportunities to update, strengthen and refine these statements. Policies are developed in changing social and political contexts and their wording responds to the problems that predominate or have been recognized. Other problems will emerge, and the wording of a policy may itself become problematic."
"It is rare to hear of repercussions for people who violate codes of ethics in any field. While having these topics outlined is nice, the next time there is a violator of the SAA's code of ethics, there needs to be a stronger show of support from the organization for whichever party is victim and a hard-lined response to the violator. These words mean nothing if there is no follow through."
"Yes, they address the ethical situations - but the truly relevant question is, do they actually get implemented?"
"As ideals, sure - as practical principles, no not really. It is entirely too easy to nod one's head and do whatever - never to be challenged. We complain about physicians, attorneys, and the police - and yet daily we protect our own. I have never heard of any archaeologist being truly disgraced by their ethical shortcomings."
NA
"The basis of the code of ethics is a great place to start however I feel like the updates that need to happen are relevant to our modern-day issues and as much as these ethics cover our bases we should also not be afraid of having stronger language to guide our members towards a much more productive and inclusive future"
"Initially, in this survey, the Code of  Ethics was defined as \"aspirational\" whic is a goal to strive for. Each of the 9 questions is about \"practice\". Practice and aspiration are not the same and many of the Principles do not address practice, they address aspiration."

As long as its not heavy handed and its for the good of everyone and the resource involved then it will work. But to say-you did it wrong but it had a positive outcome would not be ok."

"Most archaeologists believe that they can complete cultural resource inventories  and evaluate the significance of whatever archaeological traces their recognize on their own.  Archaeology needs to raise the subject of its colonist past and its continuing colonial perspectives to the forefront of the discipline, with both the academic and public sectors.  Without serious, comprehensive, and sustained attention to this matter, the SAA Principles of Ethics possess little tangle susbstance."

The world is different now than it was in 1996."
NA
NA
"The one glaring exception is that the current SAA Principles of Ethics lacks a statement to DO NO HARM. Please see the AAA Code of Ethics statement on Do No Harm. I believe it should be used as a model to revise the SAA Principles of Ethics and to require that archaeologists who excavate and analyze ancestral skeletal remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony of descendant communities shall do no harm to these communities as a result of their research. This requires collaboration and consultation in advance of the excavation and analysis. SAA members must respect the wishes of the culturally affiliated descendant communities. The one exception is when such remains are excavated and analyzed in compliance with legal requirement such as Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act or unmarked burial bills."

"The ethical principles do not address interpersonal relations: sexual misconduct, equal pay for equal work, living wages, ensuring proper credit where due (authorship, order of authorship, availability of data for all who worked on the excavation/data collection-including their students...)

The ethical principles do not address appropriate and meaningful consequences for violations of these principles.
The ethical principles do not address how to address ethical violations form other fields. For instance, a person who violated ethical principles while completing anthropological fieldwork now wants to conduct an archaeological excavation. Does the SAA, state SHPO , state museum, or the Smithsonian look at their background to assess these situations? When applying to present or attend the SAA annual meeting, are these issues consulted?"

"As I've watched the communications of SAA management over the last couple years it is clear to me that many of these managers are not qualified for the positions they hold. They have wasted too much time and money chasing boogy-men who don't exist except in the minds of the guilty. 

Many of the seedy behaviors that these managers have wasted so much time putting into writing are illegal already. Offenders merely need to be reported to the proper law enforcement people. SAA managers should get back to working on what they were appointed or hired to do. Politicizing bad behaviors should be left for others. These managers are bringing the field of archaeology down."

"The principles are not effective when the society itself has little interest in promoting them or in attempting to enforce them. Even without legal means, other means exist to enforce them. But little interest exists. The task force likely will just be a big ineffectual run around but that will allow the people specifically selected to serve (regardless of qualifications) to fill up their CV. Real progress was being made by the ethics committee when the task was taken away and everything started from scratch."

"I have always felt that the SAA P of E was too focused on minutia of professional work (publishing, data storage, etc) and not on the real impact of our field (working with descendant communities, recognizing the colonial/political impact of our findings). I have always preferred the WAC approach to ethics."

"I am a bit concerned about our version of the \"Me Too\" version in scholarly organizations. I have certainly seen some bad behavior but scholarly associations should avoid becoming police. To be honest if there is to be a \"Me Too\" movement then there should be \"I Sleep My Way To the Top\" parallel recognition. Star Chambers and Secret Police are bad ideas."

"It's a fine code but there is no enforcement."

"I agree with the principles, but they do not satisfactorily address all of these issues. Neocolonialism and collaboration are not addressed in any way. Archaeological practice should not perpetuate inequalities, and it should be acknowledged that there is no one correct way to interpret the past. Also, consequences for members who commit harassment or assault should be explicitly stated."

"The coverage is generally ok, but there is no enforcement at all. The principles are stated in a very weak form. There are articles, books, journals, projects in which archaeologists regularly violate one or more of the principles, yet nothing is done about this. I understand that the SAA cannot start enforcing these principles in a vigorous way, for various good reasons. But violators can be named, unethical practices publicized, and members and nonmembers made more aware of ethical principles and actions."

"As we discussed so many years ago when I was a Member At Large on the SAA Board in the 2000s. The Ethics code is strongest on the archaeological record; for that I am grateful to Alison Wylie and Mark Lynott. But the code remains terribly weak on the people side (descendant communities, students, etc.).  Joe Watkins may remember me as appearing (to most of my fellow board members) as a strident leftist or something in pointing these issues out, but my points have emerged through a series of egregious experiences since then.  I was told repeatedly that \"the SAA is a service organization, and has no legal teeth\": but we really could have done a better job in outlining ethical expectations then.

How I wish that the SAA had not been so risk-aversive. We could have avoided the kind of blowback (particularly after last year's meeting) that drives younger members away. I can't tell you how frustrating it has been to try to remind my junior colleagues that the SAA is US, and that starting a new organization does not fundamentally change the system. So frustrating. Anyway, it's great that you folks are returning to these issues now.

"
"I think a lot more can be done to raise the stakes of what happens when these codes are broken.  It is no longer an excuse to find wiggle room within them.  Our work has consequences well beyond the academic, and those consequences need to be more heavily thought through at the outset of any project, as well as refined and revisited as projects progress."

"Certainly if archaeologists followed all of the principles faithfully, this would be a different world. I do believe that, overall, we have a profession that is increasingly aware and increasingly moving toward better alignment with these principles. With such a diverse country and world and such a widely diverse profession, it is probably not even possible to determine whether archaeological professionals, as a whole, are addressing the principles satisfactorily. Nevertheless, from my viewpoint, I think we are moving in that direction and not slowly."
"nice document but too neutral to be actively effective I am afraid"
"As the chair of the task force that conducted the research that led to SAAs adoption of the \"SAA Statement on Collaboration with Responsible and Responsive Stewards of the Past (2018),\" I urge that we enshrine the principles expressed there in our statement of ethical principles.  This could be done by adding a principle or by strategically adding key words and phrases to existing principles.  If we were to add a principle, it should be something to the effect that best archaeological practice not only allows but requires archaeologists to recognize and mediate among ALL publics impacted by their work, not just those that they personally prioritize.  Impacted publics explicitly include descendant communities, landowners, legally compliant artifact collectors, and the general public."

"I would love to see more resources that utilize the Principles of Ethics, especially in terms of teaching, -- like the AAA has. The 9 principles are a little sticky in the language themselves, so I would not be opposed to renovations to the structure in which they are presented (like the fact that two of them are very closely related)."
NA
NA
"Somewhat"
"Well, yes, the Principles satisfactorily \"address\" a broad range of ethical situations.  The problem, of course, is that in any specific situation, there is still a lot of very difficult work to be done to find a workable, livable strategy for overcoming actual ethical problems/conflicts.  One of SAA's difficulties (and many professional organizations in the absence of actual licensing) is how to go beyond \"addressing\" toward daily implementation."
"The recent distorted interpretation of \"ethics\" as including the falsification of results and conclusions to conform to leftist \"cultural\" censorship is appalling."
"The principles do not include the climate crisis and the ethical dilemmas for coastal archaeology"
NA
"Although most of these principles outline issues I feel are important and they are all good guidelines that, if followed, could improve the field I don't find this particular set of ethical principles all that useful because they aren't that specific. Many of the codes of ethics I've used and found more useful have a couple of additional features not here: 1) they reference specific laws and other kinds of legal codes with reference to the principles, and 2) they provide some sense of what the stakes are if these principles are not followed."

"It is not direct enough."
NA
"In addition to strengthening the language in a couple of the principles, some discussion of the publication of images of human remains and/or their display on book or journal covers in the conference exhibit room should ensue. The SAA Publications committee has excluded publication of most images of human remains with few exceptions, regardless of the place of origin and even where consultation has occurred and permission is granted from descendant and local stakeholders. This scope of this ban should be revisited as such."
"I feel mixed about these - some are more updated than others"
NA
"What are the penalties for violations?  Who decides?  Who takes action?  How?"
"There's a lack of ethics having to do with interactions with people, i.e. Do no harm, and maybe even do good. Don't extract knowledge from a place without sharing results back to local communities. People over research and things (standard IRB protocol stuff). What about getting permission to work in a place (respecting local and national governments' sovereignty). There's a lot missing."
"There should be a separate principle regarding archaeological practice and descendant communities with regards to collaboration as well as respect to descendant community beliefs and practices."
"What about deaccessioning? 
What about Tribal requests to rebury collections at sites?"
"There are significant gaps in the use of digital scholarship and aspirational guidelines to avoid unclear situations--that is, guideliens that advocate for making more formal expectations of partnerships and field interactions."

"The principles still smack of colonialism and inequality"
"We need language that brings us into the digital/social media era. Its only going to become more a part of our profession- from issues around open access to what constitutes ethical and accountable behavior by organizations/institutions online and more - and in our current situation - how/when/where do we build digital content and who can/should have access.  I recognize what Im raising here is huge, broad and nebulous in some ways but we as a profession need to do more to address what are growing issues in the intersection of the past and the future"

"Some are pretty good and still adequately address our current situation. However, others, particularly those that deal with harassment and our relationship to the resources and descendant peoples, do not go far enough. Archaeology MUST be a more equitable and fair practice, and the SAA MUST take a leading stance on these issues. We have to be better than this. If we continue with these aspirational guidelines, then we must develop a code of conduct, hold people accountable to it, and remove people from membership if they violate the code."

NA
NA
NA
"The proof is in how you behave in the future. I will believe it when I see it and I do not see it yet. Words on a page are easy and meaningless the ACTIONS of the SAA in the future will determine whether or not this is a professional association worth continuing as it is I hope smaller less morally bankrupt local associations will take your place. Most of the women I know who are Archaeologists like myself have not renewed their membership and do not plan to unless things drastically change. I have joined my local state archaeological association and am proud to be a member."

Without documenting how we might actually go about making proper ethical decisions, and outlining in greater depth the ramifications that those decisions may have and why they are significant to individual archaeologists and the community as a whole, this is just a dumb document with no value beyond PR fodder."

There is an ethical demand of reciprocity for any and all groups who claim heritage to archaeological artifacts and sites that archaeologists use funding to study and build their careers and professional networks."
"The language emphasizes rule following. It reads like a legal contract. As a series of principles, it's not exactly inspiring of ethical conduct. None of them are wrong but neither are they something a trainee would turn to for a clear, resounding idea of what ethical archaeology looks like."
NA
NA
"I think there are issues that could be considered in more depth. In particular, how do we ensure there is sufficient collaboration with descendant communities? What are our responsibilities in terms of archaeological materials lost due to coastal erosion? How do we balance what we want to do with respect to our research questions with obligations to community groups? This is compounded when sites are threatened due to climate change"

"Yes, but there can be productive dialogs and conflicts that may not have adequate resolutions. Underlying this is the leveraging of culture histories to reflect sovereign interests, which in some senses is a fair play turnabout, in that early archaeology was built on the cultural need for Euroamericans to assert a cultural superiority over non-European peoples. I can't stress enough the importance of ensuring strong anthropological training for all archaeologists."
NA
"Besides my previous marking principles that badly need to be updated, there appears to be little recognition of the complexity of many modern situations. How to handle situations where various principles are in conflict is something that archaeologists need guidance.

I also think that the field needs to recognize that our behavior  should not condone activities that may be risky, like binge drinking, drugs, etc."
"Archaeologists have often developed a bad reputation with Native Americans and other descendant groups, whose ancestors created the archaeological record that we study. Archaeologists have benefited financially and intellectually from the study of this record, often at the expense of these groups, either through the loss of resources or other economic losses, or their patrimony. There needs to be a principle that specifically recognizes the interests of Native Americans and other descendant groups and the responsibility of archaeologists to give back to the members of these groups through such means as employment, training, and capacity building to empower these people to become better and more knowledgeable stewards of their own heritage. Many archaeologists have done this training indigenous people as archaeological field technicians and analysts and building local museums to support heritage tourism to aid local economies and preserve local cultures. And while I am on the subject of heritage, this might be a good place to address what cultural heritage consists of. When we talk about the archaeological record, the emphasis is on tangible heritage--the houses, pottery, and tools created in the past. But we should not ignore the intangible heritage--the customs, language, dances, and festivals associated with those material objects. It is this intangible heritage that indigenous groups are usually most interested in preserving and archaeologists must recognize the need to assist them in this respect."

Also, the issue of enforceability and what the code means practically is something I think should be closely reviewed by the committee. Should the code have a different format where breaking some code rules leads to loss of membership and others are more aspirational or best practices? There's a difference between taking 8 years to write a report and sexually assaulting someone. Is it SAA's intention to have RPA deal with all SAA ethical issues, or are we going to establish our own qualifications for retaining SAA membership? I hope the Code comes to have more teeth and I fear it is just currently a document with little real-world implications. But perhaps the way the Code is used is just not highly visible."

"Archeology has a colonial past, SAA is embedded in a context of intellectual colonialism. A central issue of our ethic should be the recognition that we are working on other countries, on indigenous lands, and writing and building careers upon that history of other people. Until such an acknowledgment, SAA is missing an opportunity to prove that current scholars are self-critical and self-aware of the power relationships between the US and other national academies. It is particularly concerning that there is no mention of respecting and abiding by the laws of archaeological research in the countries in which we work."

Basically, it as if the Hippocratic Oath said 'first do no harm' and stopped, instead of given many firm examples of behaviors that are not acceptable or are best practices. Even the Iron Age Greeks got this point.  That oath is not overly long or ponderous, please fix the just awful vague language that basically allows many bad behaviors by being so broad as to be meaningless.  It seems like an output created by some committee where no one could agree, and thus produced suggestions that could literally mean almost anything in most (not all) sections.

"Most of these Principles focus on the relationships between archaeologists and the people (including descendants) that they study--protecting sites, publishing more, not selling stuff. There is the stated need for education/public archaeology. There is no law that requires us to publish or interact with the public, but these are valued aspirations. Why is it when we get to relationships among archaeologists, we limit our statements to following laws and not to broader aspirations?"

I think the biggest \"absent element\" is some sort of acknowledgement of the power issues inherent in standing as gate keepers for scientific knowledge about the past. That position is not neutral, but it is also necessary in some ways. But I think archaeologists need to acknowledge the power that they have as legitimate scholars (even if it isn't as much power as we would like) and the need (and the ethical difficulty) of using that power legitimately and wisely. As an \"American\" organization, ideally the SAA could also undertake some deep thinking about the power imbalances between researchers from the global north and researchers and stakeholder communities from the global south -- not to mention classed and racialized communities within the global north."

"I think the existing Principles are good within a very narrow scope - of outlining a fairly self-serving vision of preserving the archaeological record for archaeologists. I don't mean that those considerations aren't important, just that they're narrow.

I think there needs to be more attention to community-based archaeology and archaeology that works with descendent communities. In that vein, I think more attention needs to be given to the specifically colonial and postcolonial political contexts that archaeology is conducted within. Trying to frame ethics in more neutral terms that leaves these power relations unnamed only re-inscribes normatively colonial and settler vantage points. As it stands, the Principles of Ethics normalizes archaeologists as the natural proprietors of the archaeological record - a state of affairs solidified in the 1906 American Antiquities Act as it classified Indigenous remains as national heritage - in a way that obscures the more complex and contested politics of who owns the past.

Likewise, I think the segment on harassment - and discrimination - needs to be expanded. In particular, the ongoing structural racism, colonialism, sexism, and classism in academic universities, as well as micro-aggressions, should be discussed explicitly. In this sense, I would take the review of the Principles of Ethics as an opportunity to frame a system of ethics for creating a discipline and practice of archaeology that better serves marginalized and historically underrepresented communities. For example, archaeology is not an especially diverse field - and I think we have an ethical responsibility to look at the systematic mechanisms that reproduce that situation and change them."

SAA needs to recognize that the vast majority of US archaeologists work in private industry and have to contend with demands of clients and federal agencies in carrying out their work.  There is no discussion in the current standards of what one should do when one's professional obligations (as set forth by these standards) are challenged by a client who doesn't want to pay for something, or who refuses to allow you to follow accepted practice.  what is the ethical standard when you have to balance one's professional standards against what you are allowed to do?"

"Could use some additional work, but it's a good start."
"There is more concern for archaeological contexts and field work than there is for explicit conduct concerning diversity, equity, and inclusion of practicing archaeologists."

"- Lack of sufficient duty of care in most points.

- Lack of consequences.

- Outdated in regards to technical advancements.

- Inadequate for archaeology as a profession. I recognize that there are many non-professional archaeologists involved in the SAA; perhaps we need separate codes of ethics. I recognize that the RPA exists; nobody I know cares about them (and in fact I have had multiple archaeologists tell me they regard the RPA as a joke). The SAA is the premiere archaeological organization in the Americas and it needs to take ownership of standards of conduct and practice for archaeology accordingly.

"They are fine when dealing with the archaeological record and its products (e.g., collections, documents, publications, archives, etc.), but still need some attention to better address relationships with and involvement of people today (e.g., communities, Indigenous people, inclusivity, diversity, non-harassment)."

"See notes regarding the principles.

"I don't want to say they are not satisfactory, because they are, but they need to go further in relation to giving people access to collections. The public is still fascinated with the \"things\"  we find, but have a strong feeling that we still lock things up and won't let people see them.  I also think we need stronger statements on striving (there we go with aspirational again) to make archaeology relevant to today's problems and concerns.  We hold this up as a rationale for our existence, but I don't see much of it in actual practice."

"I have found them altogether too focused on \"service to each other as presumed academics\" and not at all helpful in navigating the complicated ethical dilemmas we actually face. As an ethics bowl participant I definitely did not find the SAA principles provided me the tools to know how to move forward."
"With the exception of #1, the principles focus on archaeology as a research profession, even though 80 - 90% of US archaeologists now work in CRM. There are a number of international statements concerning ethical best practices for heritage management and conservation (e.g., the ICOMOS Burra Charter). The SAA principles should at least have some aspects of these rolled in, to get this list into the 21st century."

"There are some areas that could use some updating to reflect modern working conditions, but as a whole the principles are accurate and relevant."
"I didn't have the option to say that the the principles do a fairly good job of addressing the ethical situations archaeologists find themselves in today. Frankly, we are not prepared for the devastation of the archaeological record and marginalization of stakeholders that will continue occur if the anti-regulatory bent of the United States continues to flourish."

"Nowhere have you addressed that all field projects will adhere to at least the base OSHA level of safety and that every project will have a Safety Plan to ensure the safety of its employees.  In addition, archaeology is one of the worlds where a field tech may work 12-14 hour days, 6 days a week, for months on end with no break.  Those working conditions are not safe or in the best interest of the \"expendable\" technicians and SAA's code of ethics need to address it.  

No where in the SAA Principles of Ethics is consultation with descendent communities and at least listening to, if not adhering to, their concerns addressed.  This is a MAJOR problem with academic research today.

No where do you address equitable pay for any employees.  Arch techs are incredibly under paid and women still get paid far less than men.  Even a broad statement concerning treatment and fair practices in payment and employment should be included.

"As an aspiration statement, it needs to be much more strongly worded. I do not think it accurately encompasses all of our current ethical concerns today; there need to be additional principles/headers.  It would likely be easier to start from scratch and rewrite the entire document than trying to edit what is so dated and weak."

"The ethics reflect the historic development of the discipline and do not meaningfully address Native American concerns. Good faith adherence to NAGPRA, collaboration with tribes and descendent communities, and the recognition that archaeologys colonialist roots still contribute to the marginalization of Native American, African American, women, and other minorities are not addressed. 

These ethics take as the central concern objects and protection of those objects and data and do not address all of the human challenges in the field, which is a significant failing for an anthropological discipline. Archaeology is anthropology, no?"

"I would like to see a principle that addressed the history of racism and misogyny in our field head-on.  We have a long legacy of both.  I am not sure *where* to put this, but it's a cultural issue (much like alcohol abuse as described in my previous answer.)"
