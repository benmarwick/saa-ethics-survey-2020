Further, as one who was involved with a volunteer stewardship program as a volunteer coordinator, my feelings about volunteers has changed over the years.  To be an archaeologist requires a degree, when we choose to give archaeological work to volunteers over paying young, new archaeologists, we devalue our profession.  Further, in my experience, most volunteers are older and white and can afford to dabble (play) at being archaeologist.  There is an elitism to it that I think we need to be more considerate of.  

We need to reexamine our relationship with the "public" so that we are being considerate of young professionals, of descendant communities, of ownership of the past and past materials, and of opportunity. </td> </tr>

Stewardship is the usual focus of SAA (and academic) educational programming, and I would not diminish that. However, there is a far more fertile message moving into the future, which would be the use of examples from past human history to increase understanding of basic principles of human ecology: climate change, demography, economy, social structure. Our education program also has a dimension which has been increasing embraced by descendant communities where instead of telling them their own histories, we provide access to technologies that can have an important role in modern cultural practice but that were lost during the formal government and education policies of acculturation to Euroamerican values. Also, we find that the archaeological community in a corporate sense feels no responsibility to support educational programming unless they see a narrowly defined corporate benefit. In my organization, we have the advantage of developing long term (30+ year) relationships with descendant communities and individuals, and that seems to be non-existent in for-profit contract archaeology. </td> </tr>

We have encountered situations where at least one academic archaeologist paid private collectors to collect paleo Indian projectile points and other artifacts from federal lands.  Not only did he not have a permit to work on federal lands, but he also committed innumerable ARPA violations.  Through a plea agreement, only the collectors themselves were subjected to prosecution for this crime.  The academic himself received NO punishment.  There was no mechanism through either the SAA or ROPA to hold him accountable.  

Archaeologists need to be aware that their research activities are regulated on state and federal lands and internationally.  To date, the scope of federal and state regulations often appears to be unacknowledged or unknown, especially by academic archaeologists. </td> </tr>
