If so, please specify which organization's and how you have used them.",Please feel free to elaborate on your answer here:,What do you see as being the primary ethical concerns in the field today?,"Principle 1: Stewardship

The archaeological record, that is, in situ archaeological material and sites, archaeological collections, records and reports, is irreplaceable. It is the responsibility of all archaeologists to work for the long-term conservation and protection of the archaeological record by practicing and promoting stewardship of the archaeological record. Stewards are both caretakers of and advocates for the archaeological record for the benefit of all people; as they investigate and interpret the record, they should use the specialized knowledge they gain to promote public understanding and support for its long-term preservation. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:,"Principle 2: Accountability

Responsible archaeological research, including all levels of professional activity, requires an acknowledgment of public accountability and a commitment to make every reasonable effort, in good faith, to consult actively with affected group(s), with the goal of establishing a working relationship that can be beneficial to all parties involved. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:_1,"Principle 3: Commercialization

The Society for American Archaeology has long recognized that the buying and selling of objects out of archaeological context is contributing to the destruction of the archaeological record on the American continents and around the world. The commercialization of archaeological objects - their use as commodities to be exploited for personal enjoyment or profit - results in the destruction of archaeological sites and of contextual information that is essential to understanding the archaeological record. Archaeologists should therefore carefully weigh the benefits to scholarship of a project against the costs of potentially enhancing the commercial value of archaeological objects. Whenever possible they should discourage, and should themselves avoid, activities that enhance the commercial value of archaeological objects, especially objects that are not curated in public institutions, or readily available for scientific study, public interpretation, and display.
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:_2,"Principle 4: Public Education and Outreach

Archaeologists should reach out to, and participate in cooperative efforts with others interested in the archaeological record with the aim of improving the preservation, protection, and interpretation of the record. In particular, archaeologists should undertake to: 1) enlist public support for the stewardship of the archaeological record; 2) explain and promote the use of archaeological methods and techniques in understanding human behavior and culture; and 3) communicate archaeological interpretations of the past. Many publics exist for archaeology including students and teachers; Native Americans and other ethnic, religious, and cultural groups who find in the archaeological record important aspects of their cultural heritage; lawmakers and government officials; reporters, journalists, and others involved in the media; and the general public. Archaeologists who are unable to undertake public education and outreach directly should encourage and support the efforts of others in these activities. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:_3,"Principle 5: Intellectual Property

Intellectual property, as contained in the knowledge and documents created through the study of archaeological resources, is part of the archaeological record. As such it should be treated in accord with the principles of stewardship rather than as a matter of personal possession. If there is a compelling reason, and no legal restrictions or strong countervailing interests, a researcher may have primary access to original materials and documents for a limited and reasonable time, after which these materials and documents must be made available to others. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:_4,"Principle 6: Public Reporting and Publication

Within a reasonable time, the knowledge archaeologists gain from investigation of the archaeological record must be presented in accessible form (through publication or other means) to as wide a range of interested publics as possible. The documents and materials on which publication and other forms of public reporting are based should be deposited in a suitable place for permanent safekeeping. An interest in preserving and protecting in situ archaeological sites must be taken in to account when publishing and distributing information about their nature and location. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:_5,"Principle 7: Records and Preservation

Archaeologists should work actively for the preservation of, and long term access to, archaeological collections, records, and reports. To this end, they should encourage colleagues, students, and others to make responsible use of collections, records, and reports in their research as one means of preserving the in situ archaeological record, and of increasing the care and attention given to that portion of the archaeological record which has been removed and incorporated into archaeological collections, records, and reports. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:_6,"Principle 8: Training and Resources

Given the destructive nature of most archaeological investigations, archaeologists must ensure that they have adequate training, experience, facilities, and other support necessary to conduct any program of research they initiate in a manner consistent with the foregoing principles and contemporary standards of professional practice. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:_7,"Principle 9: Safe Educational and Workplace Environments

Archaeologists in all work, educational, and other professional settings, including fieldwork and conferences, are responsible for training the next generation of archaeologists. Part of these responsibilities involves fostering a supportive and safe environment for students and trainees. This includes knowing the laws and policies of their home nation and institutional workplace that pertain to harassment and assault based upon sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability, national origin, religion, or marital status. SAA members will abide by these laws and ensure that the work and educational settings in which they have responsible roles as supervisors are conducted so as to avoid violations of these laws and act to maintain safe and respectful work and learning environments.

	Aspirational Code: An aspirational code focuses on a set of shared values and ideals that encourage ethical behavior for members of the society or organization. The current SAA Principles of Archaeological Ethics are an aspirational code.
	Living Document: A living document is a set of ethical statements that can be continually updated (e.g. a blog) and provide a platform to actively respond to ethical situations and challenges. A living document usually accompanies a set statement on ethics. An example of a living document is the AAA Ethics Forum.

 If necessary:


	Separate Principles of Ethics and Standards of Practice or Performance: Two statements that address 1) ethical principles and 2) best practices for archaeology as separate documents.

I have seen archaeologists manipulate this principle, claiming they alone know what is best for the material record and therefore are better protectors of artifacts sites than the cultures to which it belongs. Even though the accountability principle recognizes the need to work with impacted communities (which means a whole host of things), there needs to be some recognition in this principle that stewardship also means working alongside specifically the community to which the site or material belongs to decide what is best.",Disagree,"This principle suffers from a lack of clarity and seemingly instates a hierarchy between archaeologists and the public. 'Public accountability' seems to infer that archaeologists need to tell the communities that they are responsible when too often it is the archaeologist that needs to be reminded of their accountability to the community. Consulting with the affected groups is great, but there also needs to be a recognition that not all impacted groups should always have equal say--the opinions of construction companies should not be weighted equally with the people trying to protect their cultural heritage from destruction. A mutually beneficial working relationship is a great aspiration as well, but we must account for those moments when communities do not want research to continue (or to start) and those wishes should be honored. Just as the stewardship principle needs to recognize accountability to descendant communities, this principle needs to recognize that stewardship of cultural heritage as decided by the descendant communities should be of primary concern when considering accountability to impacted communities.",Neutral,"I think that this is a good principle for archaeologists to follow, but not always possible for socioeconomically disadvantaged communities to follow. Who are archaeologists to come in and tell people they cannot sell objects if that is the only mode of income for feeding their families? The only ethical way archaeologists could discourage this practice is if they are offering another source of income to replace this practice.",Disagree,"This principle should be called Public education and community engagement rather than outreach, as outreach denotes a unidirectional hierarchical relationship. Ethical principles should encourage archaeologists to also learn from the communities and integrate their knowledge into the research. While we can teach about archaeology, we can also certainly do a better job learning the worldviews of those connected to the pasts we are researching. These relationships should be balanced, representing 'braided knowledge' rather than hierarchical knowledge with archaeologists on top.",Neutral,"Again, this principle should account for the desires of the descendant communities as part of that stewardship principle.
