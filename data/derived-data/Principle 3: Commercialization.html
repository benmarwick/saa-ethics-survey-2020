Two examples: 1) hundreds to thousands of dollars spent on documenting barely-50-year-old trash concentrations during a single inventory project; 2) tens of thousands of dollars to "mitigate" a small sliver of an archaeological site containing one previously documented grinding slick and a few dozen ceramic sherds and flakes (most of which had been previously analyzed). </td> </tr>

We take a strong ethical position about the commercialization of objects but say nothing about commercialization of the data, knowledge and intellectual outcomes of our work. 

We recognize there are lots of negative externalities to the commercial exploitation of physical remains. We need to similarly assess the negative externalities of commercializing archaeological intellectual property. The ethical problems of draconian copyright laws and the intrusive surveillance of commercial digital publishing platforms (not to mention social media platforms) get very little attention and discussion in the SAA.

These are big problems. If we are serious about making archaeology more inclusive and democratic, then we need to consider the ethics of how we communicate archaeology.

I would assume that similar situations apply in Latin and South America. Probably 80+ percent of the objects are in private hands. It is probably not too far off the mark to say that many pre-columbian "high art" objects are not in public settings. These objects often played significant roles in the pre-columbian communities and their careful study and documentation provides a significant insight. In many cases their exposure to modern descendant communities can provide valuable insights to the communities past. Yet, to study these clearly increases their commercial value. I have no easy solution to this corundum. I would suggest rewriting the last sentence to say something like

 Whenever possible they should carefully assess the information, scientific and descendant community benefits  that any analysis would generate and only in those cases where such benefits clearly are significant should proceed, otherwise they should discourage, and should themselves avoid, activities that enhance the commercial value of archaeological objects, especially objects that are not curated in public institutions, or readily available for scientific study, public interpretation, and display. </td> </tr>

Personally I would not want to buy any such deaccessioned object but I can't argue strongly against it. 

I think this says we should weigh the value of the work against the potential to increase looting. In Latin and South America especially it is too late. Any continuing work will increase the value of at least some objects. Shall we stop all archaeology in these places.

I guess I think that while it tries to address these questions it is aspirational and does not really give a scholar much guidance.

But I still try to treat them in a civil manner and encourage them to share information. In most cases, this has resulted in saving information that otherwise would have been lost forever. I periodically send this information to relevant site files or other repositories to ensure that the information is part of the official record. I don't know if the wording of the principle could be altered to incorporate this aspect, but I consider it a facet of public archaeology that is a sort of last-ditch effort to save as much archaeological information as possible. So many times, once the original finder or dealer sells the item, all of the original provenience information is lost. If it changes hands several times over the years, all it takes is one temporary owner to discard all of the associated information and it is gone forever. Even worse is when one of these people attributes the item to a different site to increase its value. I am dealing with a situation of this type at present. So I think there should be some encouragement to try and salvage any information possible. Perhaps it doesn't belong in these principles--I'll let the committee decide that. </td> </tr>

Why not sell an arrowhead to a interested person for a couple dollars, or a object of greater value, but not within the mandate of the institution's mission statement on Ebay?  The real issue is where those funds go.  The ethical answer is to support the preservation, care, and educational use of the core collections. </td> </tr>

Such sites and collections can include important archaeological information that, if not researched, will be lost to the profession.  It is true that by doing such research archaeologists may provide information that "enhances the commercial value" of a collection.  However, since the development of the ethics principles in 1996, the internet has created and sustained a large commercial marketplace, so it's not necessarily the case that archaeological research contributes to the enhancement of commercial value.  I believe that our challenge is to adhere to Principle 1, Stewardship, while doing our best to inform private individuals about what we see as the importance of sharing information about their objects with the profession and the public, while not contributing to the commercialization of archaeological objects or sites.  Discussions with these individuals about donating their collections and records to public repositories can produce the desired outcome.  However, for some parts of the archaeological record in North America, amateurs/private citizens find and hold the lion's share of sites and objects.  To ignore this is, in my opinion, short-sighted and impoverishes our knowledge of the past.  I would prefer to see this principle rewritten to take a more nuanced stance on working with privately-held collections while retaining the language about not inadvertently contributing to the commercialization of archaeological objects. </td> </tr>

I have never heard a colleague talk about a time when they did this (chose not to do a project because of commercial impact). I have heard many more stories, both in the US and abroad, where armed guards were hired to protect sites because of valuable objects (or rumors of valuable objects).  

While I agree with the statement, I am struggling with it, because it is something that I do not see practiced or discussed in the field.  How can the SAA, as the national organization, do more to support this ethical aspiration? </td> </tr>
