"A student oriented summary that is easily distributed would be helpful"

"There needs to be something that is enforceable. Encouragement to be ethical has not worked. In fact, overwhelmingly, it has failed. There need to be consequences and accountability for ethical behavior. If we cannot hold our members accountable than what does SAA membership mean besides a exclusive environment for those with the race, class, gender, nationality, ability, etc. privilege to be able to pay for it."
NA
"The code needs some teeth. When people sit on their data and/or violate ethical standards, there should be consequences. A living document might be maintained in parallel, but having a strong code or set of principles that establish standards and consequences is key."
NA

NA
"I think that providing examples is useful, but that specific Standards of Practice and ethics documents related to areas of work (geographic, disciplinary etc) should be generated and updated by those involved, rather than centralized in or by the SAA."

"Strongly against a living document via a blog.   As evident from the contemporary digital world, that could result in a small subset of the most radical and constantly disgruntled members to determine the nature and outcome of ethical decisions, while more balanced opinions would be drowned out or silenced."

"A living document sounds interesting - while the benefit of this procedure would be to instantaneously address a  seasonal current situation (e.g. sexual harassment, looting occurrences), the downside would be the appearance of the SAA to support criticism without the ability of others (institutions, members within the SAA) to defend themselves from accusations. There would have to be a commission formed in order to edit any statement that would be placed on SAA webpage or publication outlets."
"We need all of the different options (and to promote them all as resources) to share our standards, as different formats will be understood by different people."

I worked at a SHPO for a long time, and we always struggled with this (I know many SHPOs have archaeological standards written, we did not as our predecessors wanted archaeologists to make 'best judgement calls' rather than enforce specific procedures)."
NA
NA
"A living document will serve to continually \"take the temperature\" of the membership of the archaeological discipline; the big issue would then be how and when ideas from a living document get rolled into the set Principles of Ethics as a codified change.This should be through an established protocol that gives the membership adequate voice."

"A living document would not be good practice. It's too easy to change and could fluctuate to the point of being meaningless. Some examples and standards may be good but there are always difficult situations or those that don't fit very well into categories. An aspirational code gives us all something to strive for and practice."
NA

"I think more than an aspirational code, the code of ethics should include repercussions to the members who do not follow the code"

"There needs to be enforcement of an ethical code and consequences for those who violate it, including temporary or permanent revocation of membership. This requires clear guidelines and procedures for reporting violations and criteria for sanctions/penalties. People who clearly violate any of the principles of the ethical code should not be members of the SAA."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"We need a living document to address ethical issues as they arise. 
We need a Principles of Ethics to stand as a guideline for behavior, but also Standards of Practice to provide people a clear pathway toward following the principles. 
Providing examples helps people see how ethical principles apply to their work, how ethical dilemmas have been addressed in the past, and how to learn from mistakes. 
Each sector or region should have area-specific examples and guidelines."
NA
NA
"The scope of the SAA is probably too large to establish useful Best Practices.  These are going to vary by discipline, region, sector etc.  The SAA should support the development of these wherever possible."
NA
NA
"While hosting a forum or blog for ethical deliberation can be productive, the \"in the weeds\" nature of specific conflicts and contested actions on these public media sites can overwhelm the utility of these venues for structuring and advancing an institutional code or set of principles and standards. Living documents are best employed as supplements to membership-approved documents. When issues of broad general relevance emerge in the living document and warrant action, groups can move to amend the formal organizational statements."
NA
NA
"We need a means of holding members accountable when they behave badly."
NA
NA
NA
"Stick to what we should NOT do as much as possible/ .  Once you make a recommendation of \"proper\" behavior, then it becomes a ethical requirement that may not be appropriate in all cultures and circumstances.  There is a bit of western ethnocentrism in some of these suggestions."

"As an aspirational document, the principles are sound, however more detail and examples in Standards of Practice or in a forum where archeologist can get feedback on specific situations would be very helpful. I work in a state agency with regulatory review, and as I read through the Principles, I could identify numerous accounts of where they were not adhered to for one reason or another. If these are standards of practice, such as what the NPS has for Professional Qualifications, we should be able to reference them as a form of expectation for archeological investigations."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Best practices change over time. Ethical guidelines are intended to outline principles that can be applied to specific cases in changing circumstances. A document focused on \"best practices,\" especially if it includes an enforcement component will almost certainly be written for the 'typical' situation and become worthless in the atypical situations where ethical guidelines are most needed."
NA
NA
NA
"This is a poorly constructed question. The options are not mutually exclusive."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"If the Principles are a very high level aspirational statement then perhaps use a living document as  a means of setting out how and where the paragraph in the principle is intended to be applied?"
NA
NA
"A living document would quickly devolve into a senseless competition among those most comfortable in trying to demonstrate their superiority in a social media environment. It would rapidly become an avoidable disaster."

NA
NA
"Now that I've seen the definition of a living document, I'm firmly opposed to this. Due process exists for a reason and the living document is essentially a recreation of mob rule. The AAA Ethics forum is a fantastic example of why this approach is awful. I have never been a member of AAA and their handling of ethics is the primary reasons I refuse to join. If the SAA adopts the AAA's model for handling ethics, I will quit and never renew my membership.

I would here reiterate my comment that the term \"aspirational code\" is meaningless."

"I've outlined what we need. But please don't just write a blog. That's what the AAA has, and it has no teeth. We need a real document that we can share with our host countries, that we can use to teach our students, and that we can dangle around our \"colleagues\" who misbehave unless reminded to be good.

Let me be clear here: I have met scores of really good, ethical archaeologists who do the right thing and work hard. They don't need this Ethics Code, because they have always lived it. But there are a large number of self-serving archaeologists who evidently need to be shown what ethical behavior looks like, and they need this. We also need a solid document to share with our administrators when we seek $$ to pay shipping costs for repatriation; we need the document to share with students who join our field programs; and we need the document when problems arise that we need to mediate.

I know we are just a service organization, but I have now worked on boards or committees with every major archaeological organization in the world that affects Southeast Asia, and SAA should set the standard. I believe we can do this, and that -- with our support behind you folks -- you will.

NA
NA
"Please don't alienate even more archaeologists by overthinking everything and trying to take over every aspect of the members' lives! No reasonably intelligent person needs examples of each thing. That will just increase the length and complexity of these principles so much that nobody will read them. Keep in mind the nature of the SAA as a professional organization. Most members are here for the journal and the annual meeting--we don't want to get preached at, or even worse, have SAA turn into a Gestapo-like enforcer of every part of our professional lives. If you go too far, you are going to drive away many members, even more that the high dues already are!"
"Unless SAA wants to replace RPA, it should steer clear of enforcement. The SAA would do well to learn some of the lessons pressed upon RPA. In particular, ethics are situational and many archaeologists in Latin America see ethics very differently than their North American colleagues."

"Explicit link to corresponding legal frameworks as means of implementation"
"It seems to me that the principles should either be aspirational or they should be presented together with a \"back document\" outlining best practices.  In the latter case, the back document would be the living document that could be updated as needed.  

I tend to think for SAA, with its astonishing breadth of practitioners, sectors, geographic regions, and impacted publics, that a single aspirational document that codifies our core beliefs will be the most useful.  I think that the current principles have actually stood up quite well to a lot of time, and that working with them to reflect what seems in hind sight to be problematic rather than reinventing the wheel makes the most sense.  I suspect that if we DO reinvent the wheel, in another 20 or 30 years we'll find more wrong with the new approach than is wrong with the current principles in 2020."
NA

"I am not opposed to separate principles and standards of practice.  I think they are two different things and the latter are important but cannot be ethical principles.  It seems to me that a lot of why we have RPA is to deal with standards of practice and enforcement.  I think it would be a BIG mistake for SAA to get into enforcement.  And, by the way I have been an RPA for decades,"
NA

Any ethical guidelines will always be aspirational to some degree, but providing examples which assist in guiding archaeologists when they need help navigating situations or determining the best course of action would help make that information relevant."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I feel like the principles should stand independent of any other documents-- as an aspirational document that can be attached to any situation. Oftentimes a standard of practice is very much dependent on the context, so the two documents need to be separated.

And what difference would that make to the practice of archaeology except in the academic sector?

"To adequately address concerns like sexual harassment, the SAA needs to do a sexual harassment survey. A survey on looting, and knowledge of federal and state laws, would also be good.

"I'm conflicted about how ethical positions should be established and reproduced. Training (inculcation?) has to take place in academic settings, if only because the pace of CRM archaeology is so tight that I don't see time to be deliberative. But academic archaeology only encounters a portion of the range of ethical challenges -- if CRM archaeology doesn't have strong ethical foundations, the damage can be great in scale. I see competition, the lack of valuation of regional expertise, unprepared agency archaeologists who move to areas of in-expertise, and regulatory powers that are at best exercised on the front end of projects with no power on the back end of data and interpretive products. I'm not sure what the solutions are, but the problems go beyond \"ethical principles.\""
NA
"Aspriational Codes like the current one, are hardly very useful if they can't be applied.  The context of archaeology is continuously becoming more complex with more conflicting principles. One needs something else beyond just the codes to help people apply them, although I am not sure what would be most impressive.

Much of the archaeological literature on this issues is not very useful. Many people appear to be bragging about \"their archaeology\" when their published accounts are not necessary good reflections of what actually happened. I have found Anthropological colleagues more useful about giving advice on these matters and more  open about the ethical conflicts involved in their fieldwork than archaeologists."

"The principles have to be an aspirational code that encourages ethical behavior, there is little behavior that can be enforced. That is the role of the RPA. 

The archaeology profession has changed dramatically since its inception as has the world in which it operates. Thus, the principles that guide archaeology need to be updated and modified periodically.

An ethics forum like that used by the AAA is an excellent idea. Such a forum not only provides a platform to respond to current ethical issues, but helps individuals understand how the principles apply.

"Principles and practice should NOT be separate conceptually, though they may usefully exist as separate documents; all standards should be framed in terms of principles, and standards may usefully include examples

I support a stable code of ethics, but accompanied by a living document that enables archaeologists to discuss, debate, and sort out ethical challenges; the code should then be reviewed and updated on a regular basis--perhaps every 10 years, with the option to update/ review within that 10 year framework if necessary."

I'm not sure why Ethics and Standards of Practice should be separated.

I think the specific issues encountered in academia and CRM, as well as other specific subfields should be addressed more clearly."

"I wish there could be a combination of formats. I like the idea of an aspirational code, but there are always nuances that come up and prevent strict adherence. A living document addresses that. And creating \"standards of practice\" would be good, but difficult considering that archaeology is a wide-ranging field. And I'm not sure you can get into examples or concerns for particular sectors without getting too deep into the weeds."
NA
NA
"This survey question is strange. I think separate documents make sense as one represents and aspirational code, while the other presents enforceable standards. This can be used to more clearly separate management of different varieties of ethical challenges. The ethical practice of archaeology relating to the engagement of stakeholder communities, engagement of the public, and management of heritage are aspirational concerns. In contrast, the management of discrimination, sexual harassment/assault, and the appropriate treatment of field crews are specific issues that should strongly regulated with enforceable consequences."

"I have found the Register of Professional Archaeologists' structure of having standards of practice useful . aspirational codes provide some guidance, but primarily used to show our publics that we are \"nice people\" and to use these to advocate for our discipline. We need more to show us how to achieve those hopes. Actually, I think that all ethics codes need to be living documents. Sometimes aspirations \"lock you in\" and become unachievable, even detrimental (as was the SAA position on repatriation and reburial, and even some resistance to NAGPRA regulations). Living documents allow you to \"let go\" of ethics principles that prove to be harmful to the discipline or to others."
"Without standards of practice, principles and their enforcement becomes extremely unrealistic to fulfill."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I worry that the living document becomes no more than a conversation that's negotiable. I worry that SAA is really not in a position to enforce the behavior of others (there is no license to practice that can be revoked, for example, and then there's the question of resources to invest in investigation and adjudication). But there should be some enforcement--being barred from taking part in meetings due to a history of harassing behavior or assault, for example. Having membership revoked for egregious and well-documented illegal behavior, such as looting, for example. But recommending best practices, offering training and resources, and setting a high standard for professional behavior is all do-able and important."
"The AAA example has not been recently updated and I believe this demonstrates a weakness of this \"living document.\" I have regularly checked the AAA website re: their code of ethics and this is the first I have heard of this \"forum.\"
I think that interest groups within SAA (along with the annual meeting) are appropriate fora for discussion of ethical examples and issues. In my opinion our field is too diverse to be guided by specific ethical documents or detailed standards of practice. For archaeological fieldwork, states have standards and guidelines. Institutions/work settings usually have their own standards of practice, and so forth. I cannot imagine a committee that would include perspectives from all of the training and work settings experienced by archaeologists today, and so I cannot imagine how separate ethical documents could be effectively designed, much less implemented,"

"None of the Above. An aspirational code (like the one that the organization currently has) is closest to what I would like to see, but I want there to be consequences of some kind for not adhering to the principles. The above definition of aspirational code suggests that they can easily be ignored."

"An appropriate SAA policy should be basic, \"high-level,\" and demonstrate archaeologists' common commitment to ethical integrity.

"The Principles as they stand are broad and general. This is helpful sometimes, but there is no \"meat\" to them. That is, think of the Principles as the backbone (like the Constitution, for example) that is difficult to use in daily life. We need both generality and clarity. Perhaps those are two different documents. However, both should be \"living documents\". Maybe it's harder to change the Principles and there is an easier to change, more specific and applicable document. I don't think that this is an either or situation. Both should be living. But, because of the importance of that broader document (presumably some version of the Principles) to the \"Standards of Practice\" document the former should be more stable (but not \"dead\")."

"I have read many of the other codes that are more specific in terms of standards of practice. I find them somewhat overwhelming. I personally find having 9 (or 10) more general and concise aspirational principles to be more helpful.  I think standards of practice would be hard for this organization with such a diverse membership.

That said, I would not object to more of a living document or ethical document with examples, as long as it was accompanied by a set statement on ethics.

"Living document makes it sound like the principles can be changed willy-nilly, which should never be the case. Any changes should have to go through the Board and the membership. A platform for responding to real-life dilemmas sounds good, though. Separate principles and standards would be ideal, because one addresses ethical principles and the other deals with minimum standards of performing the work.  I would add the caveat that one of the ethical principles should be that members must abide by the standards of practice."

"I think a unifying code, set of principles or standards is important. A living document is difficult to keep abreast of; I don't follow AAA's. Having documents across sector's or regions will also be difficult to track for those of us who work widely across regions and sectors; a unified approach or at least capping approach is needed. If an approach for ethical documents that provide examples is decided upon, a living document will be needed because those examples risk quickly becoming stale, just like the existing Principles have. The code needs to remain aspirational because the current real world situation for practicing archaeologists do not permit the full ideals of even the current Principles to be fully met in practice, but we should still strive for full attainment. Finally, especially if examples are used, at no point should morals be confused with ethics."

"I do not think a blog is a useful form of \"living document\" but I suspect the organization has the resources to host an actual living document on their new website. It would be useful to hold a few check-in type forums (rather than uni-directional lectures to members) to check in with various portions of our community over time to facilitate rolling revisions. As our current process is, we have a very narrow and temporally specific snapshot."
"Even \"constitutional originalists\" occasionally acknowledge that the US Constitution is a living document via amendments. Archaeological concerns likewise vary over time and need to be updated for that reason. The near absence of heritage management concerns in our current principles reflects historical onesidedness and needs to be brought to the fore."
NA

"Although living documents are able to reflect our rapidly evolving field, it seems like it would also leave more room for a small handful of people making decisions about specific issues.

"The code of ethics is great but it should not be an \"aspirational\" code. Who is aspiring to uphold it? 

Having learned these codes as a student I thought archaeology had a very high standard of ethics. Throughout graduate school and my ensuing career, I have been continuously appalled by the \"open secrets\" of the unethical behavior of colleagues who blatantly defy this code. The lack of punishment or policing of the code points to hypocrisy, which individuals take upon themselves to correct by outing bad actors in public forums like we have seen in the SAAs before. While sexual harassment has rightfully been vilified, less public infractions such as the hoarding of data, nepotism in granting committees, and bad faith \"community engagement\" remains rampant."

NA
"Though it is good standard of practice to be an ethical archaeologist, having them combined leaves one inadequate and vague. If we elaborated on what it means to have good standards of practice then it would be beneficial to both archaeologists and non-archaeologists.

"Technically, all association principles and standards are living documents in that the association members can vote to have them, revise them, or do away with them at any time. The principles of ethics should continue to be aspirational and this is very important; we need to have ideals to reach towards. The principles of ethics and standards of practice should be two separate documents. The standards of practice should be more directive and include a code of conduct. It would be helpful to have examples and these should be available online to members as a living document that is updated relatively frequenly. Examples should describe the ethical dilemma, what principles and/or standards apply, how the situation was resolved, and what the results were (if known). It would be an interesting experiment to include a way for people to comment on the examples."

"A code of ethics for our profession is critical, but at the same time it should be general enough allow for situational judgement and some difference of opinion as to how specific principles are best implemented.
