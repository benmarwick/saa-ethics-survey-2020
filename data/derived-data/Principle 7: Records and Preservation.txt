"Principle 7: Records and Preservation"
NA
NA
NA
"Again, records and preservation are not the same thing. Maintaining and getting access to records, esp. for collections as we move to increased digital preservation and changes in de-accessioning protocols for objects, is a different matter than physical artifacts."
NA
"See answer to previous question -- we should see archaeologists as stewards of relationships, not \"the record.\" Our obligations should be to each other, our collaborators, and various stakeholders, not to \"stuff.\""
NA
NA
NA
"As we make responsible use of collections, records and reports we should also generate reports on our analytic processes, to be incorporated into the archives we have used."
NA
"This principle is perhaps the most poorly or least-often observed of the series of principles.  There are thousands of excellent collections with valuable data, but archaeologists continue to focus on excavation."
"What a joke - compliance archaeologists don't want to spend corporate profits on acid-free paper or appropriate storage, and do so only when forced. (see previous comments)"
"Working with archival and ethnographic data  is more and more the future of archaeological research and it should be encouraged, particularly for students."
NA
"It is aspirational not practice-based. Frequent handling of objects may expedite their deterioration. Records and reports are not archaeological objects."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"This needs to add that archaeologists should work with museums, archives, and other curatorial institutions to retain records and materials in appropriate conservation environments, and supervise use of records and materials to protect them from damage."
NA
NA
NA
"See previous answer"
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Yes they should but they do not."
NA
"Much more research and scholastic work can be conducted with existing collections without new fieldwork."
NA
"This needs to be strengthened to include provisions that archaeologists should not engage in work that does not include provisions for records and preservation."
NA
"Again, this is woefully inadequate and incomplete.

See my prior comments. Data publishing and archiving needs to be mandated as an integral aspect of good professional conduct. Currently, our profession has too many financial and recognition rewards for behaviors that neglect data, thereby destroying key contextual information."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Again, I believe we need to rethink the way we interact with archaeological data and recognize that the digital age is here and we will need to promote the inclusion of digital records of archaeological sites and cultural landscapes (is 3d models, aerial photography/photogrammetry, etc)."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Should it be clearer in the principles what access means? The accessibility of a digital report easily available online is different than one paper copy from 1974 that is found in the files of an archaeology lab."
NA
"Absolutely. Moreover, PIs should, out of professional responsibility, do the utmost to squeeze as much knowledge as possible out of the record as possible through multiple analyses and interdisciplinary studies."
NA
"AGain seems very out of date - would prefer a stronger statement that prior to initiating new excavation, archaeologists should maximize use of existing collections, records, and reports and minimize any new disturbance of extant archaeological sites."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Agree."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"need more sources of funding to make this a reality!"
NA
NA
NA
NA
"See response to Principle 6."
"Another significantly underfunded part of the US CRM compliance system."
NA
"This needs to be stronger.  In light of all the orphan collections that exist at universities and CRM firms, this principle needs a statement about the proper storage and care of collections so that they meet the Secretary of the Interior's Standards."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"More emphasis should be placed on the importance of heritage collections."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"this is not done enough and there is still a view among many archaeologist that working with collections and archived field notes is not really research and not really archaeology.  The society has not done enough to counter this perseption."
NA
"If anything this statement needs to become stronger. Archival research should be given the same priority and held to the same standard by practitioners as classic \"fieldwork\"."
NA
"Something in this provision should point to the need to share this info with the source country and community, particularly in the native language. However, this is expensive and time consuming, so that factor has to be taken into account."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Restriction to access is increasingly the norm. This principle as written (access to knowledge where appropriate) is key to approaching knowledge in democratic society. In an effort to afford voice to underrepresented voices, wide-ranging restriction of information is increasingly confused with respecting the authority of voices. Political expedience is overriding fiduciary responsibility and the commitment above.  Open and reasoned discussion about collective action and collective possibilities for stewardship need attention."
NA
"This statement needs revision to include a statement about NAGPRA and support for repatriation of human remains and sacred objects. Our ethical obligations are to the indigenous people first before we can consider \"making responsible use of collections...\"."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"See comments on point #5."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I don't think that this goes far enough. There should be some specific mention of federal, state, and local archaeologists' responsibilities to act more responsibly in the preservation and use of archaeological collections, records, and reports. This should also be extended to their encouraging and helping with the use of those records. We have too many managers who limit use of information or hinder its use."
NA
"Granting agencies have not yet caught up with the need to fund these aspects of archaeological projects."
NA
"I suggest adding a statement that SAA members shall collaborate and consult with culturally affiliated descendant communities and shall abide by their wishes concerning allowing others access to archaeological collections, records, and reports."
NA
"See previous remarks. I think most of us genuinely want to do this, but it is often true that funding for reporting and analysis can be difficult to secure."
"Somewhat redundant to the previous principle."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"see previous comment"
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"This should be amplified to reflect a strong positive norm in support of collections research, but also to reflect back on consulting with relevant communities, and especially descendant communities, about how this research is done."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Digitization would be one addition."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Data archiving should be requisitel"
NA
NA
"Couldn't agree more. I have been told by mid-career archaeologists that reliance on museum collections and archival records is another career-killer. One must uncover new data to advance both our knowledge and one's own career. This attitude shows a complete lack of understanding of how archaeology works. As someone associated with a major museum, I know that there is much \"new\" data to extract from old collections as paradigms shift and as methodology and understanding develop. I am very glad that the SAA offers support, though its ethical statements for the preservation of archaeological collections and records and their continuing use."
"This seems to be an elaboration of principles 5 and 6. I feel they could all be combined. Having them separate makes it seem like the minutia of publication is just as important as successful collaboration with descendant communities."
NA
NA
"Directors of projects should be open and supportive of students and others but this is also a two way street - such colleagues should respect the interests of the projects directors."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"STONGLY agree!"
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Combine with 5 and 6. Completely rethink the publication and records preservation process. Emphasize data. See comment five for further details. Breaking publication, materials, and records obligations into separate sections encourages data hoarding."
NA
"Duh"
NA
"The role of digital collections should be made clear."
NA
NA
"So I agree with this but it doesn't address repatriation at all and it should."
NA
NA
"And yet, so many people don't respect this kind of work. Academic programs often require fieldwork in order for research to be considered \"new.\" This discourages synthesis and harms our ability to live by the conservation ethic. The main thing I think is missing here is a statement about artifact conservation; a step that is often neglected, ignored, or done on a DIY basis as if professional conservators are no better at doing conservation than archaeologists are. That's like saying hobby metal detectorists are just as good at doing archaeology as archaeologists are. It's hard to convince archaeologists to spend money, but it's unconscionable to pretend that the same rules of professionalism and training that apply to being allowed to be called a professional archaeologist somehow don't apply to scientific field of conservation. You need a professional archaeologist to do archaeology, but any old archaeologist can do their own conservation if they read a how-to book? Total hypocrisy."
"I agree with the importance of this tenet.  I do wonder if it should not be expanded to provide for a mandatory archiving of records after a certain period of time.  In other words, it is often the case that field notes, etc., are lost as scholars and avocational archaeologists die.  If there was a mandate to archive these materials, perhaps future researchers could gain more from the destructive work of their predecessors (even if the predecessors were never able to publish)."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Again, why is this separate from stewardship?  If you want stewardship to just be in situ sites, change that one.
There is considerable room for abuse here.  Please include a discussion of working with descendant communities on what is culturally appropriate to them."
NA
NA
NA
"With the new free sharing platforms like academia.edu we need to remind people that sharing CRM reports are not allowed on sites like this."
NA
"Again - a very serious problem among archaeologists."
NA
NA
NA
"These records should be open access (when possible) and follow best practices for preservation of data."
"Every field work project should produce a basic report of activities and findings"
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Ditto.  I suppose my problem lies with brief ethical statements that are disconnected with the means to help users implement them.  In my former agency I had the same problem; we gave the lofty statements disconnected from real world tools."
NA
NA
"Some mention about long-term, online storage of info should be made."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"What about museums that are privately owned? Many limit access to collections- simply because they don't have funding for staff for research spaces. In principal, yes, it would be great."
NA
"Access to records and collections is the cornerstone of research. The improved methodologies, advanced techniques of investigation and analysis, and the results enhances the narrative concerning a sites or collections relevance to the interpretation of the past."
"A statement regarding digitization should be included."
"Again, open access"
NA
"While each archaeologists' individual actions in this realm are noteworthy, what we really need is a taskforce to aid in developing/funding/aiding the creation of state repository for those states that currently lack one."
"I don't like that the language of this implies an onus lies on the shoulders of students \"and others\" (who are the others, anyway?) to do the same legwork as full-time professional archaeologists to make things accessible. Also, it doesn't account for keeping certain things, such as objects of sacred patrimony, less accessible when applicable. It would be nice to see a bit more language about how digital collections etc. may be used to enhance access."
NA
NA
NA
"Again, nice sounding, lofty statements, but it is hard to find this concern for records and preservation in the real world of archaeology or understand how this principle can be enforced.  Example: I would like to see a great deal more real world support from the top down in supporting (requiring?) the inclusion of extant collections, records, and reports in research than I see."
"Except that museums and curatorial facilities need to access more than now."
NA
NA
NA
"Very general and aspirational in nature, need a seperate funding category established in grants and research projects to ensure long-term records and artifact cuartion, including broad access to digital records (within legal limits concerning site location information)."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"What can I say? Our little unexceptional U Hawaii archaeology program has spent the better part of the last decade documenting and repatriating old collections to Pacific and Asian localities from whence they came, because I pushed for it. And lots of colleagues hated me for pushing: but I was following Principle 7 of the SAA Ethics code, and they couldn't prevail.

I will add that host countries, while grappling with their own collections management issues, have largely welcomed the repatriations. And the fact that we've repatriated collections puts pressure on archaeological colleagues with collections at their home institutions to repatriate: a good thing.

But it would be nice if this were standard professional practice, rather than responses to a crabby sanctimonious archaeological colleague like me. :-)"
NA

NA
"Some much archaeological data is being produced every year that archival institutions within the government can't keep up.  The national park I work at has a 15 year backlog of data that needs to be archived so that is preserved in perpetuity.  However, no money ever comes with archaeological compliance projects to do the very important piece of archiving the data when a project is done."
NA
"I have spent my entire career trying to get professors
To have their students research old collections. 

There is little interest. They teach their students only 
To dig."
NA
NA
NA
"But is some cases such as active large mines avoidance is not the best preservation strategy since monitoring is often lacking and sites are eventually damaged. A program of excacation is warranted where preservaation cannot be guaranteeded and to ensure continue learning.Synthesis and critical review leading to development of new revised research strategies should be encouraged especially in CRM to avoid redundant data recovery efforts."
"I would change the \"should\" to a \"must\"."
NA
NA
"As I said earlier states need to step up to the curation issue. Some like Massachusetts require contractors to curate the materials excavated according to Federal Standards. (At least they used to) Some other jurisdictions, like the District of Columbia do not require that but do not have a facility for curation so in essence require private organizations to curate collections."
NA
"Maintaining physical material and accompanying forms of data storage concerning those items is becoming increasingly important. As archaeology evolves over the coming decades, fewer sites may be available for excavation; also, new analytical methods may be developed. Both conditions may make it more likely that scholars will turn increasingly to heritage collections for initial analysis or restudy."
NA
"Funding support for curation and for such work is sorely needed"
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"This principle may also be amended to include the challenges of digital preservation."
NA
"There are is a disconnect with who does the reporting and the \"determination\" of how usable the collections are in curation.  I find that people do not understand that collections that have been in storage for many years in less than ideal conditions cannot be readily made available for study and that repositories don't have the funds to make the collections available without some help from the researchers who want access."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Stronger statement needed."
NA
NA
"I believe that this is an essential principle to be encouraged and I think that archaeologists are getting better at it, though many academic institutions need to do better. Doing original fieldwork for a dissertation should not always be the only way to get a doctoral degree. In the bigger picture, it is essential that this kind of thing happen more and more rapidly to sustain the Federal Government's belief that what archaeologists do on, particularly CRM project, are in the public's best interest. There have been investigations into the use and value of collections and the amount of public money spent to curate and store them. If archaeologists do not make better use of these collections to provide the public with interesting and useful understanding of our past, we may soon find the public money for our work disappear."
NA
"We need to do the field and record a service and add the modifiers \"museum and legally acquired private\" before the word \"collections\" in this principles.  Some currently hurt the collective archaeological record by failing to record data from collections in private hands, simply because it is in private hands."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"should include language related to digital age, also stronger language to use existing materials"
NA
NA
NA
NA
"There could be sessions/workshops at the SAA meetings to help educate members about this."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Should be more explicit about this principle as part of the PRE-PLANNING of a project."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I would like to see some elaboration here as to what attention and care should look like AND a statement about access to records and collections"
NA
"Here there may be a need to address the curation crisis. The long-term feasibility of our collection practices is unclear."
NA
"There is a potential ethical conflict between Principle 7 and decisions the archaeologist must undertake in acts of repatriation of archaeological collections to indigenous people. Often, repatriation terminates \"preservation of, and long-term access to archaeological collections...\""
"Curation of archaeological materials is an important issue, as is the management of archaeological collections.  These issues might need their own guiding Principles."
"No discussion of repatriation"
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Could be stronger"
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I would note that such analyses of \"existing data\" or \"existing collections\" should still include a robust process of consultation with affected communities."
NA
NA
"Too many sites not published"
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"But see comment on Principle 1."
"Absolutely!  In Wyoming, we have a robust collections and storage facility, and more than adequate staff to manage and make available for study not only the collections, but the gray literature.  Cudos to Mary Hopkins, our Wy SHPO for decades of Superior work!"
"This is a confusing one. What does it mean and how does it differ from the other principles?"
NA
NA
"Part of this encouragement should be the promotion of digitization efforts to ensure that older collections are identifiable and accessible."

NA
NA
"This one's fine. I feel like it was covered in a previous principle, though."
NA
"The curation crisis is real."
NA
"Too many archaeologists are still digging away instead of spending a lot more time studying existing collections and encouraging their students to do the same. Furthermore, there are thousands of important, provenienced, private collections, that are not being studied for the invaluable information that they might offer. Too many archaeologists are collecting more and more materials and data and creating a deeper and ever-growing collections-curation crisis."
NA
"SAA needs to work with universities both to promote collections research for thesis and dissertation work in lieu of new excavations, and to acknowledge that work as equivalent to excavation reporting for hiring purposes.
Also need to advocate for the use of collections in CRM work."
NA
"Seems to overlap with P1 and P6. At the least, these three principles should be grouped together. But otherwise, clear."
"anticipated in my remarks from the last question. Museum collections transparency, object numbers are key - I do comparative object work, its very very difficult without this information."
NA
NA
NA
"To long - Conserve collections."
NA
"We should also acknowledge that the full scope of research has not been conducted on many existing collections and there should not be a stigma against a collections based research agenda. This ideology of long term care and research should be heavily emphasized in field schools."
NA
NA
NA
"Again, in many countries of Latin America this is a requirement of gaining permits for research."
NA
"The ongoing curation crisis indicates that, although all data should be preserved, it may be difficult to permanently preserve all physical collections.  The costs are astronomical and will only get worse.  In Arizona, some agencies have declined to curate data and collections at the traditionally used Arizona State Museum.  In some cases, they are turning to new curation facilities and museums that have been opened by Indian tribes.  This principle somehow needs to account for the possibility that we can't save everything."
NA
NA
"Curation has long been neglected and underfunded. Academic and development projects alike need to devote more resources to this important component of archaeological research."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"Must be amended to include something about digital data and digital objects and long-term digital curation."
NA
NA
NA
"If SAA really endorses this, they should provide a grant for research on orphaned or long-curated collections, like the Society for California Archaeology does."
NA
NA
NA
"This could be elaborated for the 21st c with digital data and metadata, repositories etc. While still protecting locations of sites, etc."
NA
NA
"Again, this gets promoted but not enacted.  There should be consequences for those who don't preserve and protect these records.  Whether it's through not getting grant funds or contracts.  There needs to be policies that enforce this \"principle\" otherwise no one works toward that preservation, especially in the CRM world."
NA
NA
"Here, again, there needs to be some wording about affect communities, and also a clear recognition that collection care has costs that need to be addressed prior to any collecting.Also, digital preservation needs to be addressed. Too few archaeologists are turning over their mapping data. Museums only get an 8-1/2\" x 11 map."
NA
"Collections, records, and reports from diverse sources"
"Again, this principle should account for the desires of the descendant communities, related to the stewardship principle. If relevant, the collections should be curated and reported on according to the desires of the descendant community"
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"This is a critical aspect of archaeological practice today. We must take a more active and effective role in curating and making readily available the original field materials, excavation data, analytical results, and records/reports. This is expensive, but we are losing so much information because of lack of action and funding for these crucial responsibilities if we truly believe in preserving cultural data and patrimony."
NA
NA
NA
NA
"This is a great principle, but at least in Florida, we are constantly faced with the problem of having too many artifacts and not enough storage space.  This actually prohibits responsible curation of collections in some cases.  No answers to the problem have been found, and no one has been able to bring themselves to \"cull\" the collections of insignificant materials, such as massive quantities of collected shells. How to handle this????"
NA
NA
NA
NA
"My comment about Intellectual Property is same here.  You cannot own records of legally repatriated human remains or objects."
NA
NA
NA
"Here too, more emphasis on openly sharing data in appropriate ways is needed."
"I agree, but this has also contributed to an ever-expanding collections issue."
"While this principle is sound, it perhaps does not grapple with the nuances of NAGPRA, destructive analytical methods, and the simple reality that nothing lasts forever (especially ruins)."
"And archaeologists doing the first work with collections should make their data reusable, planning that from the start."
NA
"Again, however, institutional and federal biases often work against this very principle.  My feeling is that federal agencies, in particular, often have a jaded view of archaeologists, often in practice by law enforcement, incredibly, that hampers smooth cooperation of preserving cultural resources.  Archaeologists, from my 50 year experience, are often seen as the \"enemy\" by law enforcement and some management groups.  I feel that many law enforcement officers (not the majority) have little appreciation of what archaeologists do, much less upper management."
NA

"There are some disquieting things going on in the world of curation. Theft of museum property is a big one and I have  initiated a task group to address the underdeveloped nexus between Curation and ARPA. In another area, some federal agencies (USACOE in particular) is restricting collection of artifacts (including diagnostics) on the part of its contractors in order to avoid curatorial costs. I get not bringing in another truckload of metates, but the importance of long-term curation is in jeopardy with this sort of action. Also, I question the quality of \"analysis\" that goes on in the field under a restriction like this. There are also legal questions associated: If there is a decision to not proceed with a phase 2 or phase 3 level of action, how can it be verified if questioned? The tribes and federal archeologists I have talked to about this are not happy."
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
"I am comfortable with our application of these principles in the Museum of New Mexico setting, but I am not comfortable that these principles are expressed in academic settings, both within archaeology but especially in multidisciplinary academic settings. An extreme example: The entire scientific legacy of Dr. Robert DuBois, the founder of archaeomagnetic dating in the western hemisphere, was slated to be disposed of in the landfill in Oklahoma City by the geophysics department and by his heirs. I became aware of the situation, and I was given two weeks to act. I was able to get a donor to provide funds for a moving truck, and I and two volunteers ended up rescuing 6 tons of samples, records, and equipment from destruction. Now that legacy is being prepared for use by the geophysics community as part of their world-wide modeling of the earth's magnetic field, but I have yet to see expressions of interest from the archaeological community ... we'll see."

"This is an important principle, but it has some gaps. 

The 1st sentence should use \"associated records as defined in 36 CFR 79\" instead of \"records\".  Although those regulations are for federal collections, SAA could use that definition for all the \"records\" it refers to in its ethics since it is the most comprehensive definition out there.

2nd sentence: 1) add to the list of people to encourage so it says \"colleagues, students,  descendant communities, teachers, advocationalists, collectors, and others\"; 2) \"in their research\" should also include \"in their research, heritage uses, and teaching\"; 3) is much too long overall so should be rewritten as 2 sentences.

Also, see Childs, S. Terry (2004) Our Collective Responsibility: The Ethics and Practice of Archaeological Collections Stewardship, Society for American Archaeology Press, for the many other ethical issues that stem off of this one principle."
NA
"A lot of the discussion on this topic was tied back into previous Principles and ended up almost seeming redundant. Again, the discussion was similar to that of Principle No 1 -- our priority is to the archaeological record, and not to the descendants, and so we should preserve archaeological data regardless of potential consequences.  Also, some folks revisited Principle No 5 and intellectual property and who has the right to use and interpret the data and also stewardship of records and preservations before PIs die or retire. Despite folks apparent disagreement with any type of censorship of records and preservation of records, there appeared to be general agreement that access to some records may restricted to professionals with a need to know.  Also, there seemed to be general agreement that things like burials should maybe not be shown during a power point presentation.  

Based on how all over the discussion was, my opinion is that this Principle should probably be rewritten and clarified."

"i strongly encourage archaeologists to use existing collections for theses/dissertations and to also responsibly re-house any of those collections that are being kept in disrepair and dangerous conditions.  That said, I do not think it responsible to continue curating archaeological collections--many of which are never archivally processed, made available for easy community access, or used by researchers.  Curation facilities are shuttering and collections are growing without prior planning for their care.  Curation is also an affront to many indigenous communities, as are museum practices that violate collections and distance objects from their community."

SAA should ask to see evidence of such publications before releasing research grants for the purposes of excavation, and should encourage other granting institutions to do likewise. 

Archaeologists should justify why previously-excavated archaeological sites are insufficient to answer their research questions before punching more holes in the ground. 

There should also be best practices on how to make sure that paper records aren't removed from artifact collections. There are too many orphaned collections out there, and we need to take steps to ensure that we aren't continuing to make the same kinds of choices that lead to this issue."

While continued research is the justification for curation of collections, we don't work with collections *in order* to justify the curation of collections.

And because of this we must be committed to responsible curation. Also, why is this phrased solely as encouraging other people to work with collections?"

With storage space in museums, universities, and government facilities reaching their limit it is hard to justify storing new collections when very few archaeologists themselves or their students use these collections.  This is especially true of collections from CRM projects."
"I feel that there is a problem in the way researchers handle skeletal and botanical collections that leads to the loss of information and deterioration of the specimens.  I have seen archaeologists directly handle, break in order to see the interiod of something, and neglect to replace material in its labeled container with the result that the provenience is lost and the integrity of the specimens is harmed. So, in this part of the policy there should be a statement added that archaeologists and other researchers such as physical anthropologists and botanists who study archaeological collections need to adhere to handling methods that conform to good conservation principles and expressly avoid doing harm to the material that would limit the effectiveness of its curation and make it less useful for future research."

\"...they should encourage colleagues, students, and others to make responsible use of...increasing the care and attention given to that portion of the archaeological record...\"?  This doesn't make sense grammatically.

Or is it:

\"...they should encourage colleagues, students, and others to make responsible use of collections, records, and reports in their research as one means of...increasing the care and attention given to that portion of the archaeological record...\"?  This is grammatically correct but doesn't make sense because it says \"one means\" but lists two. (Also, take out the comma before \"and of increasing the care.\""

The days of the lone scholar are long gone!  This very much needs to be revisited and more systematic data management plans should be a required part of ANY project regardless of scale."
"Again there is little support among agencies funding archaeological investigation to fund this principle."
"Once again, this is adequate as a statement. In my own experience, perhaps 1/3 of archaeologists view collections as \"theirs\" and treat them accordingly, the other 2/3 more or less follow these guidelines. What recourse is there within the framework of the SAA for those 1/3? I have reported individuals who mishandled or destroyed collections materials to appropriate authorities (government, curators, etc.) and, in a collections role, have refused access to individuals who failed to exercise proper care in the past.

In addition, creative mitigation utilizing past excavated collections should be utilized when a site is inadvertently destroyed rather than further destruction by excavating another undisturbed and protected site, yet too many aim for \"in kind\" excavation instead of detailed new analysis on existing collections which could bring more value and be less destructive to the archaeological record.  In addition, archaeology on protected sites should be discouraged unless a portion has ongoing impacts from erosion or there is other concern for data loss over time."

So. Many. repositories are unsustainable, and hold archaeological collections that do not meet modern archival standards of care.  And these same institutions that do not fund collections care often do not support repatriation, or do so grudgingly only because it is federal law.  It is honestly a disgrace to the field and to the profession."
