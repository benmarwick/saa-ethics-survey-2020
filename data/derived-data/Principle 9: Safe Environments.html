Also, let's note that even with Principle SAA 2019 still happened the way it did, not only with Yesner, but continued racial discrimination - also- why is race missing from this list? In the US, race functions very specifically in ways that are different from ethnicity, I never noticed that before. Also, veteran status is protected class, so perhaps an etc. should be added - both for US-based and international reasons. </td> </tr>

One night there, they both drank too much and he propositioned her (he *did* ask; he didn't force) and she said no. It made her so uncomfortable that she talked with a few of us about it, but -- short of her lodging an official complaint against him -- we were, I was told, unable to help her. She dropped out of the program. This shouldn't happen.


Neither should both male and female professional archaeologists violate these ethics, if having sex with undergraduate and graduate students is included as a no-no.  I know about cases from the students who slept with them: and sadly this includes two female professors and their undergraduate male students.  This shouldn't happen, and there should be penalties.

Before 2016, I thought this was about physical safety because I had seen so many team leaders ignore good practice about weather, water, safe working with tools, adequate food and housing, reasonable ladders, accommodating the smaller bodies of women archaeologists when providing equipment, being willing to abide by OSHA guidelines for standing walls in excavations, vehicle safety, parasitic diseases transmitted or exacerbated by excavation. etc. That kind of stuff, that is intrinsic to doing archaeology, and the things that have killed archaeologists over the generations. 
Now, it seems like "safety" is a code word for avoiding sexual violence and racism. Aspects of sexual violence protections are protected by law, as are racial hate crimes. Universities have broad mandates to enforce Title IX even away from the U.S. as a matter of protecting students involved in educational activities. I have thought a lot about this and feel like treating this as sexual violence only means that it ignores power differentials of several types that are intrinsic to education, to scientific research, and to work life generally. When a person is harassed or assaulted in the field or in a hotel by someone strong enough to overcome them, or armed, perhaps, it's bad but not all this behavior is illegal. When this is supervisor-worker setting, or a mentor-student setting, etc. it is a violation of other ethical standards involving the abuse of institutional or economic power and a crime. I know that this abuse was a root cause of the exclusion of women from the field for decades. Now that women dominate numerically in the field, I see that abusing economic or institutional power without necessarily involving sexual violence may be an even more profound issue, and one that I resist being labeled under "safety".

If violations occur on public lands or under federal permits, the federal government agencies may need to be involved.

It still seems to be the case that not a few researchers look at field work as a way to express yourself or find yourself romantically or sexually, and both students and local people in fieldwork situations stand in a subaltern relationship with foreign scientists, especially men but not only men.  It is still common for a researcher to form a relationship with a subaltern person that is by definition unequal.  These relationships often end with the end of the field season but even when they do not, the relationships often break up when the student of local person has difficulty adapting to life in the sphere of the researcher.  In any case, people who make these relationships often do not look at the social stratification aspect and don't consider what their effect is on the other person.  Something in the policy that acknowledges social inequality and the needd to protect "inferiors" from harm in unequal relationships might be good. </td> </tr>

The ethics of personal responsibility and safe environments needs to be clearly spelled out. This principle should stand on its own as a standard to hold each of us to. When someone violates it, that should be clear from the way the principle is written. As it is now, it seems like a placeholder that shifts responsibility to the legal system. SAA needs to be able to sanction members who don't follow ethical standards separately from whether they are technically legal or not. It's probably not technically illegal to take 30 years to report on an excavation, but the ethics of those situations are clear here. This should be the same. Contributing to a work environment that causes subordinates to feel unsafe needs to be specifically prohibited, and those who do so should be held to account whether or not their actions accord with "the laws and policies of their home nation." Are you saying that people from nations with poor records of civil rights are free to come here and harass people because it's fine where they are from? Of course not, that's obvious, but that kind of inconsistency and failure to clearly spell out what's ok and what's not too often results in failure to take action in situations where young women are put in impossible situations during their training without apparent recourse and threats to their ability to pursue their research. </td> </tr>

I think that the RPA guidelines are much better in this respect. Here they are:

"An archaeologists responsibility is to create a safe work environment free of harassment of all types, including sexual. Sexual harassment in this Code is defined as a pattern of unwanted advances, references, or remarks of a physical or sexual nature when an individual has expressed that such advances, references, or remarks are unwelcome.
 
"An archaeologist shall not engage in sexual, gender, and any other form of harassment or violence (including verbal, symbolic, or physical) against any colleague, student, employee, employer, sponsor, or member of the public in the conduct of archaeological practice. An archaeologist shall intervene when witnessing such behavior by others. Intervention is important as it substantiates claims made by those who are victims while reducing the likelihood of retaliation."

As a woman who came up through the ranks in archaeology decades ago when sexual harassment was commonly encountered, though, I worry a bit about the direction that this is taking today within SAA and academia.  Back then, we had to fight our own battles, stand up for ourselves, and demand respect.  There were plenty of good men who treated us appropriately and backed us up when we stood up for ourselves.  But, generally speaking, nobody was responsible for "ensuring" that we were treated with respect except ourselves.  Physical safety is critically important and it's everybody's job. I'm not sure that bringing up students to expect that some entity -- their university, their employer, their professional organization -- bears all the responsible for ensuring that they feel safe and protected and respected is doing them a favor.  Personal responsibility is also important.  It's good practice for life in the world, and sometimes the best approach to a hostile work environment is a little hostility of your own.  Feel free to say "OK, Boomer" now. </td> </tr>

"Archaeologists value and respect human lives and bodies" would be a better framing sentence. The explain the whys and hows of that value/respect.

This feels so wishy-washy about the actual problem: I've been sexually assaulted by archaeologists at conferences. I've been sexually harassed on the job site. I've confronted people who were engaged in sexually assaulting students while on field schools. Quite honestly, roll for "type of inexcusable conduct" and "place where you'll find archaeologists" and I can guarantee I've live it or can direct you to someone who can. Not all archaeologists are guilty of sexual misconduct and harassment, but *no* archaeologist is safe from it until *every* archaeologist loudly and constantly denounces it.

So be clear: SAA archaeologists value and respect human lives, experiences, and bodies. SAA archaeologists will not engage in behaviors or speech that devalue and disrespect human lives, experiences, and bodies. SAA archaeologists will strive to keep open and clear communication with each other on how best to foster environments that are not only safe, but thriving. </td> </tr>

If our home country's laws are more stringent, then of course those should be followed.  I'd also like to see this section have a mandate to report assaults and harassment as mandated by local and institutional law and to hold supervisors responsible for making sure all students and trainees know the policies and laws and how to report them (point of contact, phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses) and how to get other types of assistance (e.g., medical). </td> </tr>
