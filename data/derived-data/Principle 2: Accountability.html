I have seen some evidence of an increase in efforts to more broadly consult with affected groups, but there is such a long ways to go before we can begin to think that we - the archaeological community - are living up to the aspirational focus of this principle.

Active consultation requires developing long-term relationships that sometimes do not produce permissions for years. We would let someone take a backhoe to our patios without a whole lot of discussion, and yet most archaeologists seem to feel like -- if they are on public land and have official permission-- it doesn't much matter what descendant communities think. Or they focus on one sector of descendant communities who will work with them, and do not invest effort in working with the dissenters.

I'm not surprised, now, that so many descendant communities lump archaeologists with developers, because too many use their privilege to do whatever they please.  I work in Southeast Asia, and AFTER I get my official permissions I consult with local stakeholders: even when the official permitters think this is extraneous.  Occasionally I am told that we aren't welcome; most of the time we can work where we request; and everyone feels better about it. But we excavate smaller areas, and invest more time in consultation, than almost any archaeologist I know. So the field needs to support and reward people for doing the right thing. </td> </tr>

But the wrong information that purported to say that the indigenous people had no historic connection or rights to be there and be involved in governance was being promoted by the government of the country.  We researchers were able to show the local indigenous group slides of the archaeology and ethnihistory of the area that documented the strong evidence that the local group had been there for thousands of years and that the majority population of the country had only been there a few hundred years at most.  The lack of basic education on the history and archaeology of the area limited people's recognition of their rights and that limited their role in the preservation of the landscape of of their culture and population. </td> </tr>
