If so, please specify which organization's and how you have used them.",Please feel free to elaborate on your answer here:,What do you see as being the primary ethical concerns in the field today?,"Principle 1: Stewardship

The archaeological record, that is, in situ archaeological material and sites, archaeological collections, records and reports, is irreplaceable. It is the responsibility of all archaeologists to work for the long-term conservation and protection of the archaeological record by practicing and promoting stewardship of the archaeological record. Stewards are both caretakers of and advocates for the archaeological record for the benefit of all people; as they investigate and interpret the record, they should use the specialized knowledge they gain to promote public understanding and support for its long-term preservation. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:,"Principle 2: Accountability

Responsible archaeological research, including all levels of professional activity, requires an acknowledgment of public accountability and a commitment to make every reasonable effort, in good faith, to consult actively with affected group(s), with the goal of establishing a working relationship that can be beneficial to all parties involved. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:,"Principle 3: Commercialization

The Society for American Archaeology has long recognized that the buying and selling of objects out of archaeological context is contributing to the destruction of the archaeological record on the American continents and around the world. The commercialization of archaeological objects - their use as commodities to be exploited for personal enjoyment or profit - results in the destruction of archaeological sites and of contextual information that is essential to understanding the archaeological record. Archaeologists should therefore carefully weigh the benefits to scholarship of a project against the costs of potentially enhancing the commercial value of archaeological objects. Whenever possible they should discourage, and should themselves avoid, activities that enhance the commercial value of archaeological objects, especially objects that are not curated in public institutions, or readily available for scientific study, public interpretation, and display.
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:,"Principle 4: Public Education and Outreach

Archaeologists should reach out to, and participate in cooperative efforts with others interested in the archaeological record with the aim of improving the preservation, protection, and interpretation of the record. In particular, archaeologists should undertake to: 1) enlist public support for the stewardship of the archaeological record; 2) explain and promote the use of archaeological methods and techniques in understanding human behavior and culture; and 3) communicate archaeological interpretations of the past. Many publics exist for archaeology including students and teachers; Native Americans and other ethnic, religious, and cultural groups who find in the archaeological record important aspects of their cultural heritage; lawmakers and government officials; reporters, journalists, and others involved in the media; and the general public. Archaeologists who are unable to undertake public education and outreach directly should encourage and support the efforts of others in these activities. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:,"Principle 5: Intellectual Property

Intellectual property, as contained in the knowledge and documents created through the study of archaeological resources, is part of the archaeological record. As such it should be treated in accord with the principles of stewardship rather than as a matter of personal possession. If there is a compelling reason, and no legal restrictions or strong countervailing interests, a researcher may have primary access to original materials and documents for a limited and reasonable time, after which these materials and documents must be made available to others. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:,"Principle 6: Public Reporting and Publication

Within a reasonable time, the knowledge archaeologists gain from investigation of the archaeological record must be presented in accessible form (through publication or other means) to as wide a range of interested publics as possible. The documents and materials on which publication and other forms of public reporting are based should be deposited in a suitable place for permanent safekeeping. An interest in preserving and protecting in situ archaeological sites must be taken in to account when publishing and distributing information about their nature and location. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:,"Principle 7: Records and Preservation

Archaeologists should work actively for the preservation of, and long term access to, archaeological collections, records, and reports. To this end, they should encourage colleagues, students, and others to make responsible use of collections, records, and reports in their research as one means of preserving the in situ archaeological record, and of increasing the care and attention given to that portion of the archaeological record which has been removed and incorporated into archaeological collections, records, and reports. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:,"Principle 8: Training and Resources

Given the destructive nature of most archaeological investigations, archaeologists must ensure that they have adequate training, experience, facilities, and other support necessary to conduct any program of research they initiate in a manner consistent with the foregoing principles and contemporary standards of professional practice. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:,"Principle 9: Safe Educational and Workplace Environments

Archaeologists in all work, educational, and other professional settings, including fieldwork and conferences, are responsible for training the next generation of archaeologists. Part of these responsibilities involves fostering a supportive and safe environment for students and trainees. This includes knowing the laws and policies of their home nation and institutional workplace that pertain to harassment and assault based upon sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability, national origin, religion, or marital status. SAA members will abide by these laws and ensure that the work and educational settings in which they have responsible roles as supervisors are conducted so as to avoid violations of these laws and act to maintain safe and respectful work and learning environments.

	Aspirational Code: An aspirational code focuses on a set of shared values and ideals that encourage ethical behavior for members of the society or organization. The current SAA Principles of Archaeological Ethics are an aspirational code.
	Living Document: A living document is a set of ethical statements that can be continually updated (e.g. a blog) and provide a platform to actively respond to ethical situations and challenges. A living document usually accompanies a set statement on ethics. An example of a living document is the AAA Ethics Forum.

 If necessary:


	Separate Principles of Ethics and Standards of Practice or Performance: Two statements that address 1) ethical principles and 2) best practices for archaeology as separate documents.

As currently written, this principle risks losing sight of stakeholders and fetishizing materials. I was particularly reminded of the perils of this perspective a couple of years ago during a debate online about what to do about confederate monuments. One archaeologist, a Classicist, suggested that we had an ethical obligation to make sure that those monuments be preserved in a museum, even if they were taken down. Other anthropological archaeologists in the conversation suggested that we had an almost HIppocratic obligation to avoid doing harm -- and that the statues should be destroyed if they were doing harm. What was lacking in the conversation was a more applied discussion of alternatives to complete preservation and annihilation, involving digital documentation and curation. ",Agree,,Agree,,Disagree,"I feel that we should hard-wire our commitment to collaboration, but that we also need to have some language in here about how unmitigated ""public outreach"" is not in and of itself the goal. Public archaeology shouldn't be ""public relations archaeology,"" and if you are working with sensitive materials that collaborators don't want broadcasted across the universe, then you need to work closely together to determine a communication plan. ",Strongly Disagree,"This principle falls short on two fronts. One, there are some kinds of information that collaborators and stakeholders may request that we never make public, based on their rights to privacy or cultural patrimony. Two, for the less sensitive information that constitutes the majority of data that archaeologists produced, ""limited and reasonable"" is ambiguous enough that it allows bad actors to hold on to data virtually in perpetuity. So there need to be more clear implications here -- guidelines about what kinds of datasets and workflows to make publically available and how to do it. And I think that we should require the primary datasets AND processing workflows referred to in all SAA journals to be made public, UNLESS the authors can clearly cite some ethical concern about their publication.

As job opportunities have become more scarce and also of lower quality (impermanent, part-time, low-paid, highly demanding), issues caused by systematic abuse of power by supervisors have deepened, and willingness to defend oneself or others has been eroded.

While I perceive the involvement of archaeologists in owning or even trafficking antiquities to have greatly lessened, I perceive that traffickers and collectors are becoming bolder recently and are challenging the authority of archaeologists, within a broader framework of fomenting disrespect for science and professional standards. We need to strategize about dealing with this.

The principle is correct, but different types of archaeological analysis require different time frames. Those who study site distribution and architecture reap the first wave of results from survey or excavation, now further facilitated by improved remote sensing and documentation methods. They publish quickly and may seem highly ethical according to this measure, while the time-consuming processes of analyzing different types of excavated materials are left to ""slower"" meticulous colleagues who publish later, and are therefore less likely to be the PI, tenured, funded etc. Too often, the Director moves on to another high profile project, a situation that generates problems in conserving both the data and physical collections, and continues to be rewarded for rapid publication.",Agree,"As we make responsible use of collections, records and reports we should also generate reports on our analytic processes, to be incorporated into the archives we have used.

People can pay lip service to ethics, but still feel highly motivated to cut corners.

Ethical principles need to be much more integrated into the reward, recognition, and financial aspects of our profession. Otherwise, they can seem to be ""nice"" but tangential to our overall professional conduct and contributions.",Agree,"The ""the benefit of all people"" needs to be reformulated to be more true. In practice, stewardship of the archaeological record seems to mainly benefit archaeologists and the patrons of archaeology. The benefits and rewards of stewardship need to be much more democratic",Agree,,Agree,"This is woefully inadequate and incomplete.

We take a strong ethical position about the commercialization of objects but say nothing about commercialization of the data, knowledge and intellectual outcomes of our work. 

We recognize there are lots of negative externalities to the commercial exploitation of physical remains. We need to similarly assess the negative externalities of commercializing archaeological intellectual property. The ethical problems of draconian copyright laws and the intrusive surveillance of commercial digital publishing platforms (not to mention social media platforms) get very little attention and discussion in the SAA.

These are big problems. If we are serious about making archaeology more inclusive and democratic, then we need to consider the ethics of how we communicate archaeology. 
",Agree,"We should be more clear about how this needs to be multi-directional. Currently it seems all about communicating the value of archaeology outward, but we need multi-directional engagement to help shape archaeological priorities.",Agree,"Again, this is woefully inadequate and incomplete.

The ethical problems of draconian copyright laws and the intrusive surveillance of commercial digital publishing platforms (not to mention social media platforms) get very little attention and discussion in the SAA.

Commercial archaeology largely generates commercial intellectual property, and academic archaeology generates books and papers that are mainly owned by commercial publishers. Access to all of these is restrictive and involves intensive surveillance (representing a threat to privacy and academic freedom). Withholding evidence for ""limited and reasonable time"" gets abused if there are so few positive incentives to motivate comprehensive data sharing.

The SAA needs do more than pay lip-service to the intellectual property issue. Archaeologists still have too many incentives to withhold and cherry-pick data. Perverse incentives to withhold evidence lead to many of the same negative externalities that make the antiquities trade so harmful. Bad ""publish or perish"" incentives lead to the loss of primary evidence and destruction of context because too many archaeologists lack the motivation to adequately share and archive their primary data.
 ",Agree,"Again, this is woefully inadequate and incomplete.

See my prior comment. Data publishing and archiving needs to be mandated as an integral aspect of good professional conduct. Currently, our profession has too many financial and recognition rewards for behaviors that neglect data, thereby destroying key contextual information.

These were reviewed to compare with SAA and examine how each could be used to work through particular ethical scenarios. I teach a class in Ethics & Cultural Property.","Incorporating the views of outside groups into how archaeologists use cultural property and its interpretation. It seems to me this a fundamental problem, because outside folks are not necessarily focused on our goals. Thus, obligations are one-sided and we cannot expect others to act similarly. That's a structural problem. 

The conflict goes to the heart of the primary goals of archaeology, which I believe is to get to an objective truth, although we will likely never get there. Nonetheless, the goal is important to me, and if I was just story-telling, I wouldn't do it. This runs smack dab against the idea of accommodating other interpretations to incorporate other versions of the ""truth."" This goes beyond trivial examples like accommodating a biblical literalist's truth about the age of the earth. Tribes, religions, collectors, nations, past peoples and on and on - they all are affected by what we do.

It's a very complex problem, and it stems in part from an anthropological view of culture as something that is recreated constantly, incorporating and discarding parts in the process. If a culture's past is recreated in the present, then that becomes it's ""truth."" If that's its present view, and we are required to incorporate it into our discipline, then we will, on occasion, have to discard our primary goal.

Having said all that, I do believe we must ""seriously consider"" other viewpoints, however that is defined. It is both an ethic and simple politeness. But if truth is the goal, then other viewpoints will always be judged, and sometimes judged as having no value. Probably, most of the time it will not cause much conflict. The problem is when the interpretation of the ethic is that the conflict requires an archaeologist to discard the primary truth goal. 

Sorry for the preachy tone.

",Strongly Agree,"This is fundamentally problematic. It is a classic fox-in-the-hen-house conflict. Stewardship is simply a trust relationship, which requires the trustee (archaeologists) to act in the best interests of the master or beneficiary of the res (the archaeological record). The record doesn't want anything. We simply assume our masters/beneficiaries want what we want. For anyone who has asked around, this is simply not likely. 

it would be better to state what our goal is in the first Principle - truth, group advocacy, supporting people we affect - pick one. Truth using Western standards of evidence is the primary value implied in the Principle as written. Best to be clear whatever is chosen.",Neutral,"This is probably about as good as we can get. If folks are honest about it, it will work in most cases. The crux of the problem is ""affected group"", although ""consult"" is also open to widely different interpretations. 

 I think about a situation in which a group wants to consult on my work, which is on material and people who lived over 10,000 years ago in the Southeast. If I interpret ""affected group"" to encompass some reasonable standard of cultural connection, I'd be justified in concluding no one living today is affected. If I interpret the term to include people who say they are affected, then that could include tribes, Barry Fell enthusiasts, archaeologists, and Biblical literalists.  ",Neutral,"This needs to be tweaked. I agree that commercialization is a problem. But everything we publish, talk about in public presentations, etc. arguably enhances commercial value. Even if I told someone an artifact was ""rare"", its value could be increased. Maybe a partial list of things that are OK, even through they may enhance value.",Agree,,Agree,"I agree with this, but people don't often follow it.

",Disagree,"The ""archaeological record"" is itself a problematic concept, as it is essentially a metaphor derived from natural resource management fields. The term ""record"" implies some acknowledgement of the anthropogenic nature of archaeological remains, but fails to encompass the true nature of the resource, as it fails to recognize the culturally constructed nature of value underlying the resource.

We are obligated to consult with descendant populations whenever possible. If there is a conflict in terms of how resources are distributed, there will have to be ""winners"" and ""losers,"" as resources cannot be controlled by two groups at once. On the other hand, presenting alternative views based on alternative perspectives is always possible and should be done as transparently as possible. Archaeologists should also acknowledge that, by virtue of their position and funding, they almost always benefit from unequal power relationships between themselves and descendant populations and should work to minimize this inequity.",Strongly Disagree,"This needs to be re-written and clarified.

It is the obligation of the archaeological community to create broadly accessible long-term, repositories that have the capacity to authentic users and user credentials for use and access.

These objects often played significant roles in the pre-columbian communities and their careful study and documentation provides a significant insight. In many cases their exposure to modern descendant communities can provide valuable insights to the communities past. Yet, to study these clearly increases their commercial value. I have no easy solution to this corundum. I would suggest rewriting the last sentence to say something like

 Whenever possible they should carefully assess the information, scientific and descendant community benefits  that any analysis would generate and only in those cases where such benefits clearly are significant should proceed, otherwise they should discourage, and should themselves avoid, activities that enhance the commercial value of archaeological objects, especially objects that are not curated in public institutions, or readily available for scientific study, public interpretation, and display.

There is a significant literature on this. 

Archaeologists have responsibilities, yes, but are not the appropriate stewards in many situations, nor should they be. ""All people"" is a moral and philosophical stance with respect to cultural heritage and material culture. In some situations, the appropriate response for a community is to allow degradation (through use or otherwise). Also, sometimes, things should not be seen or accessed by all people.

Also, engaging the reality of the political economy of archaeology in this statement would assist archaeologists to see how the structures in which our professional lives are enmeshed, formed, and limited/enabled, has a huge, huge effect on how we interpret what should or can be preserved. In other words, most archaeologists are failing massively in terms of any kind of complete or capable or competent protection of the archaeological record, depending on how stewardship, protection, and preservation are defined (whether compliance, CRM, academic in origin). 

This aspirational principle, in its current form, is almost not helpful because of the discontinuity with what most of us are trained and paid to do most often (destroy and make limited record of contexts; with limited curation; with severely limited resource base for preservation, conservation, interpretation, access, and interoperability).  If we really took seriously this call,  stewardship would refocus every single person on existing collections and on mitigating through publication collections that result from the ongoing destruction that society deems unavoidable due to needs for nicer houses or less traffic or more electricity, etc.   ",Neutral,"Mentioning work and consultation well in advance of research, mitigation, etc. would be a positive addition here.",Agree,,Agree,,Disagree,"Often, IP that is recorded in the record belongs to OTHER people.

In CRM there are a lot of issues with keeping the budget down leading to quick, shoddy work with lack of follow-through maintaining the results long-term (digital data management, sufficient analysis and report writing time, curation, etc.). The tendency is to dig, dig, dig, when it should be to think, plan, synthesize, and only dig when you have to.

I truly believe that we shoot ourselves in the foot trying to be so secretive about sites in the interest of protection.

Community engagement is a better strategy in an age when people (rightfully) demand access to the data their tax dollars paid for. Empowering the community by letting them know of the rich resources in their area so they want to help protect them is a benefit, and I think that benefit outweighs the rare instances where people will abuse the knowledge.",Disagree,"And yet, so many people don't respect this kind of work. Academic programs often require fieldwork in order for research to be considered ""new."" This discourages synthesis and harms our ability to live by the conservation ethic. The main thing I think is missing here is a statement about artifact conservation; a step that is often neglected, ignored, or done on a DIY basis as if professional conservators are no better at doing conservation than archaeologists are. That's like saying hobby metal detectorists are just as good at doing archaeology as archaeologists are.

Setting this challenge aside (as it is being addressed by SAA in other venues), the primary ethical concern that I encounter on regular basis in my work as a public (CRM/professional) archaeologist is the lack of professional standards. There are two issues of professionalism in the field that concern me. 

The first is the quality of training at the undergraduate and MA levels. I would not describe the current status of archaeological education as ""adequate"" under Principle 8. BAs do not prepare students to work in the field. In my experience, MA standards are also often so low that recent graduates are unable to accomplish basic necessary work (e.g. fully recording their excavations, hand-mapping, setting up excavation units, calculating distances in relationship to data, etc.). As a result, CRM professionals are often not empowered to challenge unethical behavior because their training has not equipped them to evaluate the boundary between good and bad practice. This cultivates the attitude that ""that's the way things are done"" in the field, another factor encouraging a culture of silence that has numerous other negative effects (now well-documented). Add onto this the precarity of employment among entry- and early-professional-level archaeologists, and it is impossible to expect good practice to result.

The second issue of professionalism is the lack of publication in peer-reviewed venues. I do not believe that Principle 6 adequately addresses the most important underlying imperative for peer-review: oversight of practice by qualified outsiders. If data recovery projects are undertaken to preserve archaeological data as a mitigation measure, it is difficult to justify them if the data they produce are rarely (or never) evaluated in the literature. When CRM projects are reviewed by other CRM professionals only, and the field lacks a single, necessary venue for dissemination of this type of archaeological data (in the form of appropriate peer-reviewed journals accessible to all professional archaeologists), then unqualified or unscrupulous archaeologists can continue to practice. Beyond that, they can do so with a competitive advantage because of their ingorance of good practice and/or their willingness to ignore their duties. This implicates the entire field's responsibility to the archaeological record (under Principle No. 1) and to the public (under Principle No. 2).

-

Another ethical concern that I regularly encounter is the unrealistic assumptions about what a career in the field looks like in 2020. University-based research and teaching faculty at 2- and 4-year institutions train students, but they usually do not prepare them to work as archaeologists. A single field school is not sufficient preparation for field practice, and does not satisfy Principle No. 8. As a result, BAs are expected to learn on the fly in CRM. The very tight schedules and the very low budgets do not leave room for learning on the job. The result is a workforce of seasonal/hourly BAs, undertrained and overqualified (on paper). 

The underlying ethical concern, however, is how the field treats those individuals. A new graduate can reasonably be expected to have five figures of student debt (or more, if they have attended some amount graduate school [whether they completed their course of study or not]). They are then expected to spend multiple years gaining CRM experience as hourly or project-specific employees, subject to schedules outside of their control and often without access to support in the form of healthcare or other employment benefits. This set of affairs is excellent - for the owners of CRM companies who can exploit their employees without having any responsiblity to them, for the academic archaeologists who rely on unpaid labor to generate data for publications, and for the industries that seek out the least-qualified consultants they can to conduct ""oversight"" of their projects. 

The field must dedicate more care to training new archaeologists at every level and to ensuring that the next generation has the opportunity to succeed. The over-production of BA and MA students and the lack of opportunties for the overwhelming majority of them is shameful. The unrealistic expectations of students, who do not know any better, and academic archaeologists, who do know better, must change. Given my experiences, I ask myself why the field should expect to attract and retain talented young students who will perform their professional duties ethically. And this is not only a question of professional ethics or of ensuring the robustness of archaeology in the future. It is even more fundamentally a question of decency and morality.",Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Disagree,"I believe that stronger langauge is necessary to improve Principle 8.

I have seen some evidence of an increase in efforts to more broadly consult with affected groups, but there is such a long ways to go before we can begin to think that we - the archaeological community - are living up to the aspirational focus of this principle.

archaeology specifically: descendant communities (few archaeologists even now consider this), repatriating collections to home institutions (even when that means chasing down funds to help them build collections facilities), destruction of archaeological heritage & illicit antiquities trafficking. Here I am not talking about writing articles that promote one's own professional career. I'm talking about on-the-ground work with law enforcement and descendant communities and non-profits that does not yield a line in one's resume.

* those are all our responsibilities as professional archaeologists but few people I know think about them and fewer still volunteer time to address these issues: which puts an awful lot of responsibility on a very small number of us
",Strongly Agree,"Right - but a lot of archaeologists will not invest time in actually *doing* the work because it doesn't net them professional credit.  In the US, anyway, we seem to leave most stewardship to federal agencies and a few token ""public archaeologists"" rather than embedding stewardship into our projects (and asking for funding for stewardship in our grant proposals)",Strongly Agree,"Right - but this is not just a matter of submitting reports on time (a practice which some of my colleagues seem also not to do). Active consultation requires developing long-term relationships that sometimes do not produce permissions for years. We would let someone take a backhoe to our patios without a whole lot of discussion, and yet most archaeologists seem to feel like -- if they are on public land and have official permission-- it doesn't much matter what descendant communities think. Or they focus on one sector of descendant communities who will work with them, and do not invest effort in working with the dissenters.

I'm not surprised, now, that so many descendant communities lump archaeologists with developers, because too many use their privilege to do whatever they please.  I work in Southeast Asia, and AFTER I get my official permissions I consult with local stakeholders: even when the official permitters think this is extraneous.  Occasionally I am told that we aren't welcome; most of the time we can work where we request; and everyone feels better about it. But we excavate smaller areas, and invest more time in consultation, than almost any archaeologist I know. So the field needs to support and reward people for doing the right thing.",Strongly Agree,"Right again! But I only know a small handful of archaeologists who have ever, for example, worked with US Border and Customs control or the FBI to actually STOP trafficking.  There are a few exemplary non-profits now who also do great work  (The Antiquities Coalition, Blue Shield International; then for Cambodia we have Heritage Watch, and I hope other countries have similar small but important NGO's): but these aren't generally run by archaeologists.

We don't get credit for this either.",Strongly Agree,"Yup indeed. But the term ""public archaeology"" still has a slightly negative feel. People who are ""public archaeologists"" are not ""research archaeologists"" and the fact that I have nurtured a local museum for the last 20 years in Cambodia (grant-seeking, exhibits development, etc.) has not netted me ANY credit ANYWHERE.

I'm not complaining: I am actually quite satisfied with my career. But the fact that I've gotten no credit explains why so few of my junior colleagues do not consider doing such work.

An ethical professional archaeology expects all practitioners to do this work as part of their job, and rewards them for it. ",Strongly Agree,"Yes indeed. Very few archaeologists I know include their in-country colleagues as co-authors. So strange. We do this now in Cambodia and the fact that I have done it since 1999 is starting to pressure others to do the same. Ditto with my 2000-2006 policy when editing a regional journal: I asked western authors to include their in-country colleagues as authors, and that little act has begun to change Asian archaeology (I exclude China here, because they have their own tradition).

Also: too many researchers will not share data, or collections, even though they never get around to publishing them. Sometimes the collections disintegrate or lose provenience during this time that nothing is done with them. That's just wrong. ",Strongly Agree,"Many archaeologists I know love to do fieldwork. So do I. But these archaeologists hate to stop to analyze and write up what they've done. They seem to think that the very act of going into the field makes them productive, and that kind of performative mindset hurts the profession.

I was delighed, some years back, when the indubitable Egyptian archaeologist Zawi Hawass halted ALL FIELDWORK BY FOREIGN TEAMS IN EGYPT. All of it. He said that people had to first cough up more reports and publications, and then he'd let them back in the country. 

I can imagine that working with Zawi Hawass could be quite a challenge, but I applaud his decision. We need more of that.",Strongly Agree,"What can I say? Our little unexceptional U Hawaii archaeology program has spent the better part of the last decade documenting and repatriating old collections to Pacific and Asian localities from whence they came, because I pushed for it. And lots of colleagues hated me for pushing: but I was following Principle 7 of the SAA Ethics code, and they couldn't prevail.

I will add that host countries, while grappling with their own collections management issues, have largely welcomed the repatriations. And the fact that we've repatriated collections puts pressure on archaeological colleagues with collections at their home institutions to repatriate: a good thing.

But it would be nice if this were standard professional practice, rather than responses to a crabby sanctimonious archaeological colleague like me. :-)  ",Strongly Agree,"It's the wild west in our profession.  Until I intervened, our department actually sponsored an ""archaeological field school"" run by a biologist on Kauai (with nominal oversight by an archaeologist in my department who got salary but didn't go there) for students that offered them double the credits (12 credits) for five weeks of experience.  It took me several months, many phone calls and emails, and consultation with various agencies to figure out how this had happened in my own department (it was my job, as Archaeology convenor, to decide which field schools to offer). Wow.

To keep this in perspective, I once brought a UH grad student into the field in Cambodia with me who had completed a U Arizona field school and didn't know how to use a transit. U Arizona is MY alma mater! I was fortunate that one of my Cambodian students knew how to map and could train the American student. But still.

 I would love to see RPA or SAA certification required for all credit-bearing field schools.",Strongly Agree,"The sexual harassment situation is a lot better now than when I was a student (and we warned each other when groper archaeologists were in the vicinity), but it still happens. And we don't effective ways of dealing with it. As one example, a female graduate student in our program accompanied a colleague to China for fieldwork. One night there, they both drank too much and he propositioned her (he *did* ask; he didn't force) and she said no. It made her so uncomfortable that she talked with a few of us about it, but -- short of her lodging an official complaint against him -- we were, I was told, unable to help her. She dropped out of the program. This shouldn't happen.


Neither should both male and female professional archaeologists violate these ethics, if having sex with undergraduate and graduate students is included as a no-no.  I know about cases from the students who slept with them: and sadly this includes two female professors and their undergraduate male students.  This shouldn't happen, and there should be penalties.

",Strongly Disagree,"As we discussed so many years ago when I was a Member At Large on the SAA Board in the 2000s. The Ethics code is strongest on the archaeological record; for that I am grateful to Alison Wylie and Mark Lynott. But the code remains terribly weak on the people side (descendant communities, students, etc.).  Joe Watkins may remember me as appearing (to most of my fellow board members) as a strident leftist or something in pointing these issues out, but my points have emerged through a series of egregious experiences since then.  I was told repeatedly that ""the SAA is a service organization, and has no legal teeth"": but we really could have done a better job in outlining ethical expectations then.

How I wish that the SAA had not been so risk-aversive. We could have avoided the kind of blowback (particularly after last year's meeting) that drives younger members away. I can't tell you how frustrating it has been to try to remind my junior colleagues that the SAA is US, and that starting a new organization does not fundamentally change the system. So frustrating. Anyway, it's great that you folks are returning to these issues now.

",Neutral,"It could definitely take stronger stands.  I love the fact that some countries will only give permits to archaeologists if they include funding and a plan for either site conservation or a local museum or training. Why not require that of all archaeologists working everywhere, and then work with major funding agencies so they include these activities under what they will fund?  It could work.",Disagree,"But I want to support you folks because it's a good start, and so much better than the opaque AAA Code of Ethics. At least I can use the SAA Code of Ethics for teaching, and then elaborate. Keep up the good work: and don't be afraid to push more aggressively. Our timidity in the past came back to bite us.",Yes,"I've outlined them in my previous comments. 

We need to all remember -- even people working in Illinois' American Bottom, or in the middle of New York state -- that we are guests in someone else's heritage world.  Most archaeologists remain remarkably arrogant: a relic of the white male privilege in which our field emerged, sadly.",1,2,3,5,4,Separate Principles of Ethics and Standards of Practice,"I've outlined what we need. But please don't just write a blog. That's what the AAA has, and it has no teeth. We need a real document that we can share with our host countries, that we can use to teach our students, and that we can dangle around our ""colleagues"" who misbehave unless reminded to be good.

Let me be clear here: I have met scores of really good, ethical archaeologists who do the right thing and work hard. They don't need this Ethics Code, because they have always lived it. But there are a large number of self-serving archaeologists who evidently need to be shown what ethical behavior looks like, and they need this. We also need a solid document to share with our administrators when we seek $$ to pay shipping costs for repatriation; we need the document to share with students who join our field programs; and we need the document when problems arise that we need to mediate.

I know we are just a service organization, but I have now worked on boards or committees with every major archaeological organization in the world that affects Southeast Asia, and SAA should set the standard. I believe we can do this, and that -- with our support behind you folks -- you will.

I think this says we should weigh the value of the work against the potential to increase looting. In Latin and South America especially it is too late. Any continuing work will increase the value of at least some objects. Shall we stop all archaeology in these places.

SEAC","1 ) ACADEMIA
Students who take on graduate studies are not guaranteed professional relationships with mentors and colleagues. 

Academic professors are not vetted for there ability to foster professional mentorships and/or to provide a certain standard of academic guidance and caregiving to the students they have accepted.

Professors/academic staff seemingly have free reign to weed out students who are not ""immediately participatory in"" and/or ""fully adept at"" any necessary departmental politics. Students who are prone to think critically, and independently or students who seek the full boundaries and characteristics of collegial atmosphere may be steered out of academic programs. 
Archaeology/anthropology professional relations are not taught or reviewed in undergraduate studies.

Archaeology/Anthropology graduate studies can be an extreme investment financially, personally and professionally and student debt is at and all time high. These circumstances can disproportionately affect nontraditional students, or those students that are the first in their family to seek a higher education - PhD. or M.A.

2 ) ON CALL ARCHAEOLOGY
I am unfamiliar with the circumstance in most states but in one of the most expensive states to reside ""On Call"" or gig archaeology employment is in many cases the only opportunity for employment in the discipline. Having participated in ""On call"" archaeology for 5 years after gaining my M.A. degree and having worked full time in Archaeology/CRM for 3 years post B.A. and before the M.A., I believe I can offer important insight.
Companies that provide on-call archaeology opportunities take zero responsibility in the unfortunate circumstances and short and long term health and lifestyle effects of this type employment. They offer no increased wages/compensation for this ""on the fly"" and often last minute request for field staff and immediate project/client responsive deployments. Many times field deployments are into extremely harsh and totally unfamiliar work environments for unknown amounts of time and they put stress on personal health and personal/family relationships. Many deployments put personal safety in a whole different category as a result of unfamiliar work and living arrangements. From my observations other on call archaeologists (M.A./B.A) who may be desperate for steady work may chose unsafe work relations mistakenly placed in the category of ""a competitive work environment"" in order to prevail as the higher performing employee.  

Many of the companies providing these opportunities seemingly adopt a ""good doer"" or ""employment proving hero"" type of attitude by saving you from periods of unemployment. In reality they are capitalizing as much as possible as a result of this gig economy and they are perhaps normalizing one of the most unfortunate aspects of this career. In reality many of the supervisors of on call employment have little to know knowledge of the circumstances of this type of employment, as it's possible many have never operated as on call archaeologists. In addition the on call field archaeologist can provide higher quality and better responsive field archaeology then the supervisors can guide or recommend. Or they are providing a work talent that is difficult to find but completely underappreciated and under-compensated for. Supervisors may be much more recent company hires as a result of their client relations or computer/gis skills. Full time employment is thereby gained as result of having clients that you bring in as a new hire and may have nothing to do with quality work or dedicated on call response with a particular company.

 ""On call"" opportunities typically provide no guaranteed compensation for all the pre-deployment correspondence/scheduling, the many work supplies (dig kit/recordation material), the storage for all these supplies including personal PPE during gaps between work, the yearly resume updating, or the necessary timecard and expense processing. Because many clients or companies require receipts for food expense reimbursement there can be zero privacy in personal food purchase and consumption.
On call archaeologists can make no long term planning and or important financial decisions about their lifestyle as a result of unpredictable work opportunity.

These circumstances mandate a closer look at the trajectory of employment in the field of cultural resource management, and whether CRM can be a self respecting and mentally healthy career opportunity and feasible career choice. If this status quo continues more transparency is needed about the characteristics of the lifestyle before students pursue academic studies gearing them in to this direction. Also, companies should be confronted about their part in the exploitative circumstance.

I have recently started a new small business and one of my top priorities is to address this exploitative circumstance. I hope to offer public and community archaeology education outreach and or indigenous archaeology as additions to CRM projects throughout the year and thereby minimize on call employment or seasonal work. If there are grants or other funding opportunities for these diverse employment opportunities and engagements and SAA can help facilitate this please highlight this information in future SAA updates and opportunities.

Many, many roadblocks may occur to keep a project from reaching this ideal. There is usually not enough money to thoroughly analyze and report on a project, there are not always sufficient outlets where it may be published, and depositing of both data and artifact collections are among the most contentious issues facing our field.

",Agree,"I believe that this is an essential principle to be encouraged and I think that archaeologists are getting better at it, though many academic institutions need to do better. Doing original fieldwork for a dissertation should not always be the only way to get a doctoral degree. In the bigger picture, it is essential that this kind of thing happen more and more rapidly to sustain the Federal Government's belief that what archaeologists do on, particularly CRM project, are in the public's best interest. There have been investigations into the use and value of collections and the amount of public money spent to curate and store them. If archaeologists do not make better use of these collections to provide the public with interesting and useful understanding of our past, we may soon find the public money for our work disappear.

As it currently reads, it implies that excavations or analyses inexorably lead to enhancement of the value of archaeological objects. I don't think that's the case, particularly when outreach/education about archaeology and the information gleaned is presented to the community. With rampant vandalism, looting, or large-scale destruction of archaeological sites due to conflict, development, or profiteering, this principle seems insufficient.

",Neutral,"In addition to strengthening the language in a couple of the principles, some discussion of the publication of images of human remains and/or their display on book or journal covers in the conference exhibit room should ensue. The SAA Publications committee has excluded publication of most images of human remains with few exceptions, regardless of the place of origin and even where consultation has occurred and permission is granted from descendant and local stakeholders. This scope of this ban should be revisited as such.  ",Agree,"I agree to a certain extent, with provisions previously indicated. I conduct field and lab research in other countries beyond the US as well, so would like to see some broadening of the ethical statements to include responsible cooperation and collaboration with antiquities organizations, training opportunities for students or local residents in that country, etc.  Too many still operate in a very colonialist mode, which should be discouraged.

Not all stakeholders are equal. For example, it should be made clear that archaeologists need not assist white supremacists in promoting racist ideologies. Furthermore, archaeologists should include consultation with various publics in the design of research, too. Engaging with the public should involve determining how our research design or research outcomes (e.g., aDNA studies) could be misappropriated by stakeholders with marginalizing intents.

Specifically, ROPA and Wyoming","At the federal level, many federal archaeologists are poorly qualified to hold the positions they hold .Bad management results.  In the Rocky Mountain West, there is a current trend of overemphasizing Native American ""consultation"".  Too frequently a ""tribal position"" is taken as gospel, i.e. ""all sites are sacred and you archaeologists (read blue eyes) shouldn't tough them.  Let them be destroyed"".  This violates Section 106 consultation, to the delight of  pro industry land managers and developers. The minority of consulting archaeologists who do bad work, i.e. blow off sites, has diminished but is still a problem.  TPOs come and go, but frequently engage in unethical behavior, due to financial considerations or their lack of adequate training and education. NAGPRA is a totally abused system, NPS, as well as select federal agencies, has sold the farm on NAGPRA,  repatriating back to whomever just to clear the shelves of archaeological materials, not true NAGPRA articles.  This is a very serious and growing problem that SAA should be extremely concerned about.   ",Strongly Agree,,Agree,"Native American consultation is certainly appropriate.

How?,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Yes,"The overemphasis on Native American control of public resources.  The mis-application of NAGPRA by NPS and other federal agencies.  Look at NPS's NAGPRA training: it's structured to and for Tribal entities, to the detriment of legitimate physical anthropological and archaeological investigation and scientific study.  DNA research should be a required element  of human remains study when considering repatriating human remains many hundreds, certainly thousands of years old.  How else are we to untangle issues surrounding the population of the Americas?  Trashing the very resource, the tools of legitimate scientific inquiry by repatriating lacking adequate and complete scientific study (and analysis) to me is a SIGNAL violation of archaeological ethics. 3-D imagery of soon to be repatriated material should be a requirement of NAGPRA materials.  Outside the U.S. this doesn't seem to be an issue but here in teh Rocky Mountain West, it's a pandemic of it's own. ",,,,,,,Looks OK to me.  Enforcement is the key issue,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I believe that the ethical standards need to be supplemented by membership rules. We must take a firmer stance on these issues. ",Strongly Agree,,Neutral,"We need to go further here. This seems to be directed towards academic archaeology, where the work is optional. We should include a statement that archaeologists should not undertake any work, including compliance archaeology, for which they are not prepared (either because of a lack of education on the topic, or a lack of resources to conduct the task in a timely manner). Archaeologists should be required to refer potential clients to other archaeologists or specialists if they themselves are not able to adequately handle the job.

We MUST hold ourselves, and each other, accountable regardless of the location and institution. ",Disagree,"Some are pretty good and still adequately address our current situation. However, others, particularly those that deal with harassment and our relationship to the resources and descendant peoples, do not go far enough. Archaeology MUST be a more equitable and fair practice, and the SAA MUST take a leading stance on these issues. We have to be better than this.

They must be universal, and be better than ""comply with local laws"" because many times the law itself is unjust. ",Disagree,"Same as before. These principles need to be stronger, no matter the context. In my case, as a tribal liaison, I must hold myself up to standards far beyond what the SAA currently holds.

As with most SAA documents, it foregrounds the legal aspect -- but there are generally few laws in the US and elsewhere regarding things like misgendering a field school student.

1) The need for archaeologists to publish their field investigations in a timely manner, i.e. within 12-16 months. Too many archaeologists have never published their field work, even after decades. They are no better than looters.

The quality and quantity of public education and outreach are simply inadequate to preserve the archaeological record to the extent it should be preserved.

A few are working very hard at this but barely making a dent since they do not have the entire SAA membership engaging in such efforts. ,Strongly Disagree,My understanding is that too many archaeologists are still too proprietary about their data yet they are not publishing it and making it widely accessible. This is wholly unethical and these archaeologists should be held accountable. They are not. ,Strongly Disagree,Too many archaeologists are not publishing the results of their work and making their data widely accessible. This is true of both academic and CRM archaeologists. ,Strongly Disagree,"Too many archaeologists are still digging away instead of spending a lot more time studying existing collections and encouraging their students to do the same.

'Public accountability' seems to infer that archaeologists need to tell the communities that they are responsible when too often it is the archaeologist that needs to be reminded of their accountability to the community. Consulting with the affected groups is great, but there also needs to be a recognition that not all impacted groups should always have equal say--the opinions of construction companies should not be weighted equally with the people trying to protect their cultural heritage from destruction. A mutually beneficial working relationship is a great aspiration as well, but we must account for those moments when communities do not want research to continue (or to start) and those wishes should be honored.

But there are several areas where the current principles do not go far enough. Principle Number 9, for instance, says that archaeologists are responsible to know the laws and policies of their home nations and institutional workplaces, and to abide by them. But this implies a narrow legalistic approach that does not respond adequately to the range of behaviors that can create hostile or just unpleasant work environments for many (especially junior) archaeologists.  Avoiding any sort of harassment, bullying, or discrimination against coworkers, subordinates, or colleagues should be a principle of archaeological ethics, regardless of any particular nation's or institution's policies. This principle is especially important in archaeology, where field research often creates social situations where it can seem that normal rules of social interaction do not apply (though problems can arise in any academic or work setting, not just in the field). Supervisors and organizations have a responsibility to not just avoid harassing or bullying subordinates, but have an ethical responsibility to deliberately create an environment where such behavior is not tolerated and all participants can participate safely. 

The non-harassment, non-bullying ethical principle should also extend to peer reviews. Critical reviews are sometimes warranted, but using the cover of anonymity to attack and insult authors or unfairly characterize their work (or to unreasonably promote the reviewer's work) is both common and deeply unethical. It should be explicitly covered in the SAA Principles, and SAA should ensure that reviewers for the society's journals do not engage in such abuse.

I also would argue that depite the current Principles 6 and 7 (concerning reporting and data sharing), there are ethical concerns surrounding data availability and replicability of analyses. SAA should push for open science policies for archaeological data, to the greatest extent possible. There are, of course, issues with site location data, but whenever articles are published, data (and code related to analysis) should be made available. SAA could and should do much more to promote this kind of data sharing (by requiring a data sharing statement with every article published in the society's journals, for instance).

",Agree,"I do have some questions about how this applies to archaeologists working in cultural resource management, who often are forced to decide what can and cannot be preserved, and who are frequently forced into situations where limited time or money force uncomfortable decisions.

Additionally, I would add that the sale of archaeological material can be done in an ethical manner.  An example is unprovenienced objects.  Why not sell an arrowhead to a interested person for a couple dollars, or a object of greater value, but not within the mandate of the institution's mission statement on Ebay?

This individual has continued to treat the excavation records as personal property even after more than 50 years.  Not only has he been unable to complete a report, he has refused yo make the information available to other scholars as well as the federally recognized tribe (Onondaga Iroquois).

We have seen the impact of section 106 of NHPA as a commercial enterprise, and I acknowledge that the federal government was and is unprepared to meet the ongoing challenge of 106 without private sector assistance. But I fear that ARPA and NAGPRA will become a ""cash cow"" for some archeologists. While I support fully our legal system's due process, those cases in which I have been involved showed a lack of concern on the part of archeologists working for the defense for substantive efforts in their side of case management. In other words, it looks to me like they are just out for the money. Attacking in court a Damage Assessment document prepared by a federal or Indian archeologist is, I suppose, fair game, but the notion that archeologists may find a source of income from this troubles me greatly and I firmly believe that it falls into the category of ""unethical."" ",Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Agree,"ARPA requires, where possible, the determination of Commercial Value defined in the Act as the ""fair market value"" of the objects (in the condition prior to the commission of the prohibited acts). The tribes with whom I routinely work understand this, although they find it alien and insulting. But where human remains and other ""NAGPRA items"" are concerned it reaches another level. Placing a commercial value on human remains should be avoided at all costs. I have sought and obtained letters of support for this which I include in Damage Assessment documents where appropriate. Perhaps some specific language regarding the higher level of concern for human remains and other items as defined by NAGPRA would be beneficial to this statement. ",Strongly Agree,,Agree,"For me, the operative phrase is ""no legal restrictions"". The dissemination of this knowledge is essential if archeology is to grow. However, there must be careful consideration as to the consequences of sharing information. Even at the state level my interaction as a federal archeologist was hampered by their insistence that site location data would be shared (gotta get that trinomial, right?), but that the information would then be available on the state's internet for researchers and contractors. I insisted that unless the state would provide a firewall and involve me as the person directly responsible for what is otherwise unavailable information, even under a FOIA, I would not share data. I felt that I had the responsibility to know, and approve, of who was requesting access to this information. My bureau requested this three years in a  row and got no response from the state archeological survey.",Agree,"Use of reporting formats that lend themselves to easy redaction of specific site location information is a good practice.  I'm not fooling myself thinking that the looters don't know more than we do, but we still have to do the right thing.

3) Honoring the legal and cultural values, in the United States, that privilege private property rights over public rights.
4) Developing and implementing triage criteria in the preservation, recovery, analysis, and interpretation of cultural resources information in the face of cultural resources destruction by development.",Agree,"My only hesitations are that 1) ""avoidance"" (in situ preservation by deferring action) is not always preservation, and that natural processes should be considered in the inherent loss of information through time; 2) We are increasingly confronted with the issue that ""for the benefit of all people"" is not a cultural universal, and that some descendant communities have a vested interest in histories that cannot be confirmed (and in some cases are denied) by archaeological investigations; and 3) there is a difficult-to-negotiate line by pandering to voyeurism in building public support for stewardship and considering the interests of descendant communities (often we, as archaeologists, are less sensitive to the derivation of our own values from a Euroamerican cultural value system).",Agree,"This touches the conflict between public (majority) interests and affected (minority) interests, usually of descendant communities. The ""goal of establishing a working relationship"" presupposes that all descendant communities want a working relationship, which may not be the case for reasons that are unrelated to archaeology and that are part of the overall ""colonial trauma.""",Agree,"There is no question that I agree with this principle, but on several occasions I have been asked by collectors to look at objects with their goal of my informally validating ""authenticity."" These identification activities have occasionally revealed that what they have inherited or purchased are actually clever forgeries. In two cases, my assessments have actually stopped the individuals from participating further in the antiquities trade because it demonstrated both their lack of judgment and the lack ethics on the part of the sellers. This is where, as a contract archaeologist in a museum setting, there is a public obligation to educate, while adhering strictly to the museum policy that prevents formal authentication or valuation.",Strongly Agree,"If the public is not convinced of the value of knowledge derived through archaeology, then cultural resource preservation (law and regulation) will disappear. Stewardship is the usual focus of SAA (and academic) educational programming, and I would not diminish that. However, there is a far more fertile message moving into the future, which would be the use of examples from past human history to increase understanding of basic principles of human ecology: climate change, demography, economy, social structure. Our education program also has a dimension which has been increasing embraced by descendant communities where instead of telling them their own histories, we provide access to technologies that can have an important role in modern cultural practice but that were lost during the formal government and education policies of acculturation to Euroamerican values. Also, we find that the archaeological community in a corporate sense feels no responsibility to support educational programming unless they see a narrowly defined corporate benefit. In my organization, we have the advantage of developing long term (30+ year) relationships with descendant communities and individuals, and that seems to be non-existent in for-profit contract archaeology.",Strongly Agree,"Agreement, but with several twists ... As a State entity within a museum system, all of our information (data) is treated as public record. Despite the challenge (risk) to our not-for-profit enterprise model, we try to find the time to answer all questions, whether from students, scholars, peers, the public, or tribes. In an extreme (and dysfunctional) extension of that responsibility, individuals (non-academic?) have misused the New Mexico ""Inspection of Public Records Act"" to force our office to do research for them that they could and should do for themselves. On the flip side, we have had tribes request the sequester of archaeological information, outside of any legal framework such as NAGPRA, where I am actually in fear that an Inspection of Public Records Act request will force me to violate the tribal request. Initial sequester requests have had a strong basis in cultural values, but increasingly we see sequester requests that appear to be based on sovereignty exercises, both as simply as an exercise of sovereign rights and as a means of damaging the cultural interests of other sovereigns.",Strongly Agree,"Our office, subject to confidentiality restrictions, makes all of our substantive documents accessible to the public through PDF downloads. The confidentiality restrictions are based on statute, regulation, and practice within New Mexico contract archaeology, and are widely adhered to.",Agree,"I am comfortable with our application of these principles in the Museum of New Mexico setting, but I am not comfortable that these principles are expressed in academic settings, both within archaeology but especially in multidisciplinary academic settings. An extreme example: The entire scientific legacy of Dr. Robert DuBois, the founder of archaeomagnetic dating in the western hemisphere, was slated to be disposed of in the landfill in Oklahoma City by the geophysics department and by his heirs. I became aware of the situation, and I was given two weeks to act. I was able to get a donor to provide funds for a moving truck, and I and two volunteers ended up rescuing 6 tons of samples, records, and equipment from destruction. Now that legacy is being prepared for use by the geophysics community as part of their world-wide modeling of the earth's magnetic field, but I have yet to see expressions of interest from the archaeological community ... we'll see.",Agree,"We try to adhere to these principles, but there are notable cases in CRM where ""low bid"" or corporate connections have resulted in underqualified individuals pursuing both the field archaeology and analytic studies associated with projects. The only examples that come to mind are self-serving, but are nonetheless appropriate. Arizona-trained archaeologists trying to apply pottery typologies that they think are relevant but aren't in the analysis of New Mexico pottery collections, resulting in the inability of the data to contribution to regional questions of culture history. Also, Four Corners trained and experienced archaeologist applying well-established Four Corners interpretative models in settings where they are inappropriate (""Ancestral Puebloan"" masks the need to create at least four completely distinct culture  histories from before the advent of pottery in the Southwest), resulting in the failure to perceive (in the data!) important variability.",Strongly Agree,"This is incredibly important, but it has been a work in progress.

The SAA has one award named for a known sexual predator ... but I haven't seen any will to undo the situation.",Strongly Agree,"Yes, but there can be productive dialogs and conflicts that may not have adequate resolutions. Underlying this is the leveraging of culture histories to reflect sovereign interests, which in some senses is a fair play turnabout, in that early archaeology was built on the cultural need for Euroamericans to assert a cultural superiority over non-European peoples. I can't stress enough the importance of ensuring strong anthropological training for all archaeologists.",Agree,"A aspect of archaeology, especially public education and outreach, needs to focus on human ecology as an antidote to the resurgence of a bigoted movement toward ""American Exceptionalism."" The former would be adaptive, the latter will hasten the decline of the values reflected in the principles of ethics.",Agree,I would like to see some explicit discussion of how we can improve our adherence to these principles within CRM.,Yes,Perhaps thinking more in terms of building a foundation for more explicit triage decisions as the pace of cultural resources destruction increases while the resources to mitigate that destruction shrinks.,2,4,1,5,3,"I am satisfied with the format of the current Principles,An aspirational code,A living document","I'm conflicted about how ethical positions should be established and reproduced. Training (inculcation?) has to take place in academic settings, if only because the pace of CRM archaeology is so tight that I don't see time to be deliberative. But academic archaeology only encounters a portion of the range of ethical challenges -- if CRM archaeology doesn't have strong ethical foundations, the damage can be great in scale. I see competition, the lack of valuation of regional expertise, unprepared agency archaeologists who move to areas of in-expertise, and regulatory powers that are at best exercised on the front end of projects with no power on the back end of data and interpretive products.

Archaeologists need to consider archaeological sites and archaeological collections, including all the digital associated records they produce, as equally important resources.

Therefore, archaeologists must be accountable to the public for the proper use of those dollars.  Consultation is critical whether formal or informal.",Strongly Agree,,Agree,"This is an important principle, but it has a few gaps.

Other ""publics"" that need education and outreach are developers, private land owners, and granting organizations. Granting organizations, in particular, don't seem to value the responsibilities and activities associated with taking care of and accessing/researching/interpreting collections as much as sites. Both are part of the archaeological record and both need support.

",Neutral,"This is an important principle, but it has some problems and gaps.

Many archaeologists, especially academics, do not understand that the associated records, as defined in 36 CFR 79 for federal collections and in state/tribal/local laws, are the property of the landowner, now usually a government agency. The records, including analytical data, must be curated as part of the archaeological collection owned by the property owner (in cases of private land owners, hopefully transferred to a repository or an agency by via a Deed of Gift), even if no objects were recovered.  The text in the 3rd sentence -- ""no legal restrictions or strong countervailing interests"" -- is not adequately explained.  I just explained the ""legal restrictions"" that are very prevalent out there. What are examples of ""strong countervailing interests""?

Who are ""others"" in the last sentence??  Really should be ""the public"".

Need to discuss intellectual property rights either in this principle or in a separate one.",Neutral,"This is an important principle, but it has some gaps.  The emphasis on publication is a bit much when the ""other means"" of ""public reporting"" aren't stated. They could be museum exhibits (either in a repository or online); public programming, i.e., lectures, teaching kits; or wayside signs on a trail, among other things.  The emphasis on ""publication"" caters to academics, which are not the majority of the archaeologists out there now. Most CRM and gov't archaeologists don't publish since there are no business incentives to do so.

It needs to be explicit that the research can be of either sites or collections!  

The 2nd sentence is problematic.  Suggest something like ""The associated records -- documents and analytical materials on which all forms of public reporting are based--, should be curated in a repository or archive for permanent safekeeping according to applicable laws, regulations, or policies."" 

The last sentence is fine for sites.  However, there needs to be an additional, similar sentence that all publications and public reporting should identify the repository where the collection is curated for future access and use. It could say something like: ""An interest in preserving and enabling future access to archaeological collections must be taken into account by identifying the repository where the collection, whether objects and associated records or associated records only, are curated in all forms of public reporting."" ",Neutral,"This is an important principle, but it has some gaps. 

The 1st sentence should use ""associated records as defined in 36 CFR 79"" instead of ""records"".  Although those regulations are for federal collections, SAA could use that definition for all the ""records"" it refers to in its ethics since it is the most comprehensive definition out there.

2nd sentence: 1) add to the list of people to encourage so it says ""colleagues, students,  descendant communities, teachers, advocationalists, collectors, and others""; 2) ""in their research"" should also include ""in their research, heritage uses, and teaching""; 3) is much too long overall so should be rewritten as 2 sentences.

Also, see Childs, S. Terry (2004) Our Collective Responsibility: The Ethics and Practice of Archaeological Collections Stewardship, Society for American Archaeology Press, for the many other ethical issues that stem off of this one principle.",Neutral,"This only focuses on fieldwork.

Development of professional standards for Curation of electronic records in perpetuity.  Treatment of women and minority groups especially in field and professional situations. Appropriately balancing professional voice with descendant voice. Teaching ethics. ,,"In general, folks seemed to feel that the conflict between archaeologists and descendants could be resolved, and that proper stewardship does allow for multiple uses of the archaeological record. However, the question regularly arose “as archaeologists, is our primary responsibility to the record or to the descendants or to the field of archaeology?”.  In general, it was agreed upon that archaeologists’ primary responsibility is to the archaeological record. If this means that we excavate a threatened site to collect data against the wishes of descendants, then so be it. If this means that we preserve a site for the future and don’t let archaeologists dig it today, then so be it. A minority opinion was that, as anthropologists as well as archaeologists, our primary responsibility was to the descendants. ",,"What is meant by a “higher claim” in terms of application? Despite the above argument that archaeologists should place a priority on the archaeological record, there is a genuine recognition that other groups may have other priorities. In terms of working wiht other groups, it was agreed upon that this is a good thing but someone needs to be THE decision maker. However, there was a lot of disagreement over who THE decision maker should be. Many folks felt it should be an archaeologist, some folks felt it should be a descendant, and some of the older and wiser folks among us suggested a neutral arbitrator in which all stake holders brought their claims to the table, and then the arbitrator would make the final decision.  

In terms of public accountability -- again, no one disagrees with this idea, but how is it enforced? Who decides what is enough public accountability? What IS public accountability? If this principle was rewritten, more specific information along these lines seem warranted.",,"Political exploitation is different than commercial exploitation, and needs to be addressed. It could be a separate principle, or this principle could be expanded. Archaeology is used by the media to support or refute modern political issues (such as laws effecting casinos or health care) as well as used to legitimize some groups and not others (such as the Navajo reservations recent requirements for archaeologists to use the derogatory term “Anasazi” in any reports written for the Navajo nation) or the popularization of Kennewick man as evidence of early Anglo occupation in the New World. Archaeological data are used to spread misinformation concerning modern political issues, and it is the responsibility of archaeologists to not allow their data to be used in such a way, or to publicly correct such misuse of their data through editorials or other public venues. ",,"We should include as part of our statement the recognition that soldiers are a special class of the public that need to be educated, and potentially the SAA should create a special committee to work with the military. 

Archaeological projects -- whether they are using undergraduates or using public volunteers -- can be equality rigorous.  If “public education” programs are thought of and ran like a good field school, then there need not be a difference between the “rigor” of projects.  It is probably more an issue of attitude on the part of archaeologists and academics then an actual difference in project quality. 

Can public outreach projects be certified through RPA like field schools can be? Would that be an approach to creating a sense of “rigor”?",,"This topic caused the loudest, most aggressive, and most defensive discussion even though every one seemed to agree. It is generally agreed upon that the archaeologist who did the work “owns” the data and the interpretation -- not the descendants, not the university, not the museum, not the funders. UNLESS there is some pre-agreed upon contract, documents and data belong to the archaeologist (the PI).  HOWEVER (again the older and wiser PIs among us) agree that arrangements need to be made as to the long term stewardship of such information BEFORE PIs die or retire, and that consulting with descendants prior to publication might be in order. ",,"Clarification and further elaboration would be nice, including how this integrates with Principle No 5 ",,"A lot of the discussion on this topic was tied back into previous Principles and ended up almost seeming redundant. Again, the discussion was similar to that of Principle No 1 -- our priority is to the archaeological record, and not to the descendants, and so we should preserve archaeological data regardless of potential consequences.  Also, some folks revisited Principle No 5 and intellectual property and who has the right to use and interpret the data and also stewardship of records and preservations before PIs die or retire. Despite folks’ apparent disagreement with any type of ‘censorship” of records and preservation of records, there appeared to be general agreement that access to some records may restricted to “professionals with a need to know”.  Also, there seemed to be general agreement that things like burials should maybe not be shown during a power point presentation.  

Based on how all over the discussion was, my opinion is that this Principle should probably be rewritten and clarified. ",,"No one disagreed with this principle, however it generated a lot of discussion. Is it ethical for departments to be churning out so many PhDs with emphasis on becoming an academic when academic jobs are so scarce? There appears to be a move away from MA and CRM programs, shouldn’t we be seeing more of these at universities rather than fewer?  How do we truly integrate our academic programs to train students to go into CRM and Government jobs?

In my early days I was on a survey of a couple of thousand acres with 20% visibility and an average shovel test interval of 1 per acre. (Now I would sue a company that tried that.)

Most of these issues address archaeologists' responsibilities to other archaeologists, students, and the archaeological record. Unfortunately, the current code does not adequately address ethical issues and archaeologists' responsibilities in dealing with the public, in particular Native Americans, descendant groups, and others concerned with the archaeological record.  ",Agree,"Archaeologists are not the sole stewards and caretakers of the archaeological record, but must recognize that Native Americans and other descendant groups also have concerns and interests in the conservation and protection of that record.

Archaeologists have benefited financially and intellectually from the study of this record, often at the expense of these groups, either through the loss of resources or other economic losses, or their patrimony. There needs to be a principle that specifically recognizes the interests of Native Americans and other descendant groups and the responsibility of archaeologists to give back to the members of these groups through such means as employment, training, and capacity building to empower these people to become better and more knowledgeable stewards of their own heritage. Many archaeologists have done this training indigenous people as archaeological field technicians and analysts and building local museums to support heritage tourism to aid local economies and preserve local cultures. And while I am on the subject of heritage, this might be a good place to address what cultural heritage consists of. When we talk about the archaeological record, the emphasis is on tangible heritage--the houses, pottery, and tools created in the past. But we should not ignore the intangible heritage--the customs, language, dances, and festivals associated with those material objects. It is this intangible heritage that indigenous groups are usually most interested in preserving and archaeologists must recognize the need to assist them in this respect. ",Disagree,"As stated elsewhere, I don't believe that principles adequately deal with issues affecting Native Americans, descendant groups and other affected parties. The existing principles focus on the concept of dong ""no harm."" But we also need to address archaeologists responsibility to do 'good"". The great bulk of archaeology today is publicly funded. We not only need to make our research relevant to the public, but must also work to contribute to the public good.

I use the ethics codes for teaching courses in higher education and in my publications.

The current SAA code of ethics places too much emphasis on the archaeologist as the steward of the archaeological record. This is problematic because NAGPRA has established that we, as archaeologists, must share our stewardship responsibility with a diversity of stakeholders. A greater emphasis on living people also refers to issues of harassment in the workplace and the field. We are supposed to maintain professional relationship with our colleagues but I wonder if the SAA code of ethics should contain stronger language on gender-based, race-based and other forms of harassment.",Neutral,"The principle places great emphasis on objects but people, other than the archaeologist, enter in as an almost afterthought in the form of an amorphous totality (""all people""). Although protecting the archaeological record for ""all people"" sounds like a nice idea, in practice this type of statement leads into a myriad of ethical quandaries. For example, ideas of national patrimony and world heritage are used to marginalize indigenous people in Mesoamerica and other parts of the world by providing a justification to remove people from their land. Several decades of research have demonstrated that object focused archaeologists will likely not have a bright future because indigenous and descendant communities all over the world are increasingly demanding stewardship over their heritage. Thus, I think we need a first principle that emphasizes a shared responsibility over the archaeological record and some mention of archaeologist conduct in relation to living people.

Principle 1 has a lot of merits but it makes no mention of our responsibilities to collaborate with descendant groups or to avoid harming living people.

I think it is simply public knowledge. So, for example, site locations are specifically exempted from FOIA because of the idea that public knowledge of site locations poses a danger to them. I think experience shows that in fact that far greater danger comes from the public NOT knowing where they are, because when the public is in the dark there is no push for protection in the face of development. I also think we need to re-evaluate the assumption that government agencies actually care about preservation. Once this is acknowledged, it becomes clear that limits on public access to information generated through archaeology actually undermines preservation.

Tribal participation and leadership in excavating prehistoric sites are still the exception, not the rule. Archaeology is a tool that is a necessary precursor to project development often, and too often the standards of CRM are not high enough. Tribal history is mangled through outdated boilerplate language, lack of time, or any number of factors. Same may go for some sites with special significance for historical minority communities, religious groups, women, and LGBT contexts. This is a structural issue of bad CRM budgets for atypical projects that may take more time and care to research and analyze. It is ethically bad, and it reduces the impact and significance of our work for these communities.

Publication: This is an old ethical issue that continues to be unaddressed. Projects frequently get dropped by the field personnnel due to priorities, change in career, loss of institutional support, whatever. We need to as a discipline ensure that at a minimum field reports are always completed. Repositories should all know which collections have been written up, to what degree, and finishing these reports should be prioritized over new fieldwork more often (i.e. in all cases unless the fieldwork is to address an imminent threat). 

SAA hostility to many of its members: This doesn't need to go in our Code, but there needs to be substantial structural change in how the SAA as an organization sees its responsibilities to the discipline and its members. This predates last year's conference debacle, but was reflected in it.  SAA is sitting on a stockpile of $8 million. We are in an international crisis. Groups like AAA are doing emergency loans and sharing the wealth. SAA is writing emails that provide their members with the option of asking for a refund for the 2020 conference, but the language was mealy and seemed designed to shame people into not requesting a refund. SAA seems to make a lot of its decisions based on what is easy and safe for the organization, not what is needed to protect people (the women at least year's conference) or make the discipline grow. Without commitment within the organization's staff and leadership, the Ethical principles overhaul is going to end up stuck in a committee that is not empowered to pass a set of ethical principles unless the staff and board support it. Given the decisionmaking by executive leadership over the last year, I do not want them making ethics-based decisions.",Agree,,Disagree,Doesn't go far enough for marginalized groups. Doesn't clarify what happens when motives/best interests of the archaeologist's client are different to that of the tribe,Neutral,,Disagree,"This is not sufficiently bidirectional (i.e. assumes public has nothing to offer archaeologists) and should point out that public archaeology can/should be more than information out, there should be interaction and potentially more public investment/influence over research questions and interpretive products when desired.",Strongly Agree,What's a limited and reasonable time? What's countervailing interests? What's the method for enforcement? Otherwise good,Strongly Agree,"Could get more detail, but good",Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,"This is a real issue in CRM and sometimes in academic contexts where people bite off more than they can chew. Often people have expertise for some types of sites and not others. Sometimes their bosses write the proposal and make presumptions that they can direct a project. Also this is very ""self assessment"" oriented. Some people are very confident and other question themselves and never feel they are ready. And the former set of people are more likely to create issues when they assume they are qualified. And there is a business pressure to assume qualification.


How can we write this in a way where people are more reflective of this and interrogate themselves a bit more? Maybe provide a list of especially challenging site types that are more complex? Provide a set of questions that people should ask themselves?",Strongly Disagree,"This should not be laws and policies focused. In most states and most countries, gender identity is not a protected class. SAA members shouldn't discriminate even if it happens to be legal and it should be a violation of the ethical code to discriminate unless there is a present and clear safety danger to having someone present at a dig (i.e. if a trans woman applied to excavate in Saudi, that's an area that is complex ethically and needs some thinking through).",Disagree,"The code hits most of the broad topics that I think are important, I would not advocate for removing any of the principles. However, it needs to be gone over carefully to make sure it goes far enough as I have put in comments about.

Also, the issue of enforceability and what the code means practically is something I think should be closely reviewed by the committee. Should the code have a different format where breaking some code rules leads to loss of membership and others are more aspirational or best practices? There's a difference between taking 8 years to write a report and sexually assaulting someone. Is it SAA's intention to have RPA deal with all SAA ethical issues, or are we going to establish our own qualifications for retaining SAA membership? I hope the Code comes to have more teeth and I fear it is just currently a document with little real-world implications. But perhaps the way the Code is used is just not highly visible.",Disagree,see other comments,Strongly Disagree,"In government regulation, policy, and compliance this Code does not really address at all the responsibility of the CRM practitioner has for stakeholders, tribal groups, etc. That's a very tricky issue because obviously the CRM practitioner also has legal responsibilities to their client.

And I think we should shift the discipline so that archaeologists ensuring adequate consideration for descendants is seen as integral risk mitigation for their client and as part of best practices.

Many of us probably believe that by learning about the human past we are informing the present and preparing for the future.  However, there exists a great disconnect between the work we do as archaeologists and our engagement with the public.  One of the primary problems is the that our data and our publications are often hidden from the public behind paywalls.  If we are really to be a public good as field, we need to do everything in the open.  This is how we build the ultimate trust with the public.  It is disingenuous for to try to inform the public about the past but then hide our raw data and our main publications from them.  They should be able to check our work, as we all should be able to check each others work.  We need to be a science that includes reproducibility in our workflows.  We must as a society take a stance for open access publication of our articles/books, data, and our methods (such as source code).  This has to be a major component in our service to the public.

However, a significant amount of research takes place outside the US, and even that research within the country takes place in lands belonging to or associated with indigenous people. Stewardship as caregivers implies a sense of property as if we are THE people with authority to speak of how other people should engage with archaeological sites. The word has no recognition about our role as subject to other countries' laws and the decisions of indigenous communities. We SHOULD be advocates, and we should hold ourselves to a high standard. Still, we should also, as a discipline, acknowledge we have not been chosen to be the custodians of the archaeological remains and materials just because we study them.

",Disagree,"This phrase: ""An interest in preserving and protecting in situ archaeological sites must be taken in to account when publishing and distributing information about their nature and location"" implies that we are the ones that should be making a choice whether to disclose the location of archaeological sites. This goes directly against the laws of many other countries in which we practice archaeology. This is the same issue I see with stewardship in that we put ourselves in a position in which we are the ones called to make choices about someone else's past. In these principles, there is no acknowledgment of our obligations to existing laws and regulations in the areas in which we work.",Agree,,Agree,"Where can we find "" the foregoing principles and contemporary standards of professional practice""?

Among the most serious of these is the insistence of the archaeological community that they can and should speak for cultural resources writ large, not just the scientific or cultural interests of archaeology. 

CRM, academic, and state and federal archaeologists regularly recommend (and often say that they have determined) that no historic properties will be effected by undertakings if significant archaeological resources are not found during a survey. Even when Tribe have identified ethnographic resources or TCPs, many archaeologists insist that they have addressed Tribal concerns through archaeology, or by noting that popular collections of Indian legends don't mention their project area. Further, many CRM firms recommend archaeological monitoring during projects, even when the concern is for ethnographic landscape or other resource values important to Tribes. 

This outrageous behavior serves the business interests of archaeologists, and creates busy work to keep archaeologists employed. It does not, however, benefit the resources or tribal communities for whom they hold value, and the SAA needs to discourage their members from doing this. 

Many archaeologists also insist that working with looters is ethical, since looted collections may still have scientific value.

It is not a notification letter, or asking for affected communities to observe archaeologists on a project in the field. It is a meaningful discussion where the answer to question asked of Tribal communities can be ""no"", and the archaeologists have a responsibility to respect and abide by that answer. To often, archaeologists rely upon state or federal agencies to engage tribes for them, or insist that they are bound by their contracts, signed before any tribal engagement occurred. 
",Strongly Agree,"Yet, some current SAA committee members actively encourage working with looters. ",Strongly Agree,"Public education is not the primary function of the archaeological profession, and what does occur is usually focused on the majority community, rarely acknowledging the relationship of American archaeology to native communities. Archaeologists excavate ancestral Tribal villages and sites, yet  they usually don't make the effort to include Tribal peoples in studies. Archaeologists continue to want to study Indian stuff, without input or interference from actual Indians.",Agree,"I agree, but tribal communities must have a strong voice in what happens with the physical remains of their ancestors. Many are happy to have material stored in museum for display or future research, but others want materials returned to the earth after the study is completed. There are complex ethical issues about preservation, but also about political and economic power, the legacies of colonialism, religious and cultural values, etc. This decision cannot be left to archaeologists alone to decide. ",Strongly Agree,"The appropriate place for safekeeping is not in a CRM office - SHPOs and museums should have all original materials, and the funding from the CRM companies to maintain them. ",Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,"And yet, at least one ACRA and SAA member proudly says that their CRM company use untrained day laborers for archaeological fieldwork - as long as the boss has an MA, all legal obligations have been satisfied.

Many CRM archaeologists do not work for the long-term conservation and protection of the archaeological record. Archaeologists are not a caretaker for other peoples' pasts and do not work for the benefit of all people--most certainly not for the descendants of the communities that generated the archaeological record.  Indigenous people are the caretakers and stewards of their past and it is not a responsibility that has been delegated to archaeologists. ,Disagree,"Archaeologists should do much more than consult with affected groups.  The groups affected by proposed archaeological efforts should collaborate, at minimum, as a full partner and, preferably, co-design any research and work plans. ",Disagree,"There is no mention here of the atrocities of antiquities looting and black market sale upon the communities to which those objects belong.  The highest and best use of archaeological materials is not always public education, display, curation, or study. ",Disagree,"Archaeologists in public education settings often overreach and present themselves as experts in other peoples' history.  They often misinterpret, mischaracterize, and sensationalize aspects of living peoples' culture in ways that are disrespectful and harmful.  Archaeologists must better own the destruction and disenfranchisement that their own professional fieldwork and curation protocols create. ",Strongly Disagree,"This principle does not reflect the fact that archaeologists often do not honor the intellectual property of indigenous communities when they offer insights, explanations, or assistance with interpretations. There is also no discussion of confidentiality agreements, co-stewarding of data, etc.  Additionally, archaeologists have long treated their personal research as a personal possession and there remain many collections that are unavailable for viewing, use, study, or exhibit by others.  A limited and reasonable time to retain original materials is not decades or someone's lifetime, but that is the reality in the discipline today. ",Strongly Disagree,"There are federal and state laws on this subject.  Much more stringent ethical codes are needed regarding the distribution of archaeological data to the public.  Again, there needs to be a recognition of indigenous data sovereignty and cultural mores related to the transmission of certain knowledge and that recognition needs to lead to far more thoughtful implementation of open access protocols.  Furthermore, documents should be held in safe spaces, but not in spaces where indigenous community access is limited or restricted.  Finally, there are far more details to concern ourselves with that just the location of an archaeological resource. ",Disagree,"i strongly encourage archaeologists to use existing collections for theses/dissertations and to also responsibly re-house any of those collections that are being kept in disrepair and dangerous conditions.  That said, I do not think it responsible to continue curating archaeological collections--many of which are never archivally processed, made available for easy community access, or used by researchers.  Curation facilities are shuttering and collections are growing without prior planning for their care.  Curation is also an affront to many indigenous communities, as are museum practices that violate collections and distance objects from their community.

The SAA Ethics Guide refers to this issue in Principle 6, but its a bit subtle and lost in other issues related to publication within the same principle. 

For the ethical practice of archaeology, I use the principles of Community-Based Participatory Archaeology as outlined by Sonya Atalay (2012) Briefly, it can be stated as 1) the use of a community-based, partnership process 2) that is participatory in all aspects, 3) that builds community capacity, 4) that engages in a spirit of reciprocity and 5) that recognizes the contributions of multiple knowledge systems.","This likely varies by locality, but in Southern California, where I work as an archaeologist for a government agency, I have found the work of archaeologists working in CRM firms to be woefully lacking in rigor and accountability. I have found, for example, numerous instances of archaeologists using pedestrian surveys to speak to the likelihood of sub-surface cultural resources. I have seen archaeologists more concerned about their employer's budget than they are (which is saying something) and using that as a reason to resist doing any archaeological testing (only pedestrian survey and monitoring). If they do test, many only want to use augers, even in highly sensitive archaeological sites. I see archaeologists propose collecting artifacts during surveys and testing when there is no budget for analysis, curation, or reburial. I also see CRM archaeologists routinely use boilerplate historical/ethnographic background sections more brazenly plagiarized than almost anything I experienced teaching undergrads for five years. At times, the ethnographic background sections are taken from other reports that were clearly located elsewhere in California. Some (though not all) have a very adversarial relationship with local tribal communities. In short, as the SHPO has no set standards for CRM work, the result has been a prolonged ""race to the bottom"" quality-wise. 

In academia, the lack of community-based participatory research is distressing. The practice of individual archaeologists and academic institutions buying land for the purposes of excavating without having to answer to the local community should be banned. ",Strongly Disagree,"This principle is more honored in the breach than the observance. Archaeologists are still far too eager to punch holes in the ground instead of investigating previously-excavated collections. Doing so is not made any easier by poor curation practices. Additionally, this principle does not recognize that archaeologists are not the only stewards of archaeological materials. Descendent communities, who have a greater claim as stakeholders of cultural resources usually have different views from archaeologists of what stewardship looks like, and their wishes should be prioritized more than others. More often than not, the ""benefit of all people"" hides a colonial mentality, which extracts material resources from their place of origin for the benefit of a very small public, one, if we're being honest, really just benefits the archeologists involved.  Archaeologists can easily manipulate this principle, claiming they alone know what is best for the material record and therefore are better protectors of artifacts sites than the cultures to which they belong. Even though the accountability principle recognizes that archaeological practices should recognize the wishes of the communities most impacted by their work. The ethics committee can look to the ethical principles of community-based participatory research for direction here. ",Neutral,"I feel like this principle is trying to say that archaeologists are accountable to the public, but is poorly-written and easy to misunderstand. It would be better to recognize that there are many publics, and some (such as descendent communities) should be given greater weight than others. It would also be good to recognize the imbalance of power between local communities and archaeologists (and the research institutions or developers they represent). All too often, the weight of compromise is placed squarely on the shoulders of the local community. We must account moments when communities do not want research to continue (or to start) and those wishes should be honored as much as possible by archaeologists.",Agree,"It would be good to mention something about the reality of economic disparities between archaeologists and local communities. Ways of promoting the local economy-- more than just the temporary hiring daily workers, but things like providing job training opportunities, tutoring school children, donating to local non-profits, providing English classes, etc.) should be thought of as a means of mitigating the destructive nature inherent in archaeology. This will help steer community members away from looking to looting as a source of income. Also, archaeologists should be encouraged to giving talks in the local language about the danger that looting represents to the community.  I don't think it happens much any more, but archaeologists have a history of buying sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony  by applying various kinds of duress, particularly to impoverished communities. I think it would be good to acknowledge archaeologists role in creating a market for looters, so as not to place all the blame on economically disadvantaged individuals. ",Neutral,"This principle assumes that archaeologists are the sole bearers and transmitters of knowledge of culture. This principle should be called community engagement rather than outreach.  It is true that there are many publics, and that content should be tailored to the needs of those publics, but it would be good to include mention that the primary beneficiaries of community/public engagement should be the local community most closely associated with archaeologists' locus of research. ""Outreach"" sounds very one-directional, disengaged way of communicating information to communities. Archaeologists should be encouraged to learn from communities with an open mind,   and integrate their knowledge into the research. This does not mean that they should compromise their own scientifically-based knowledge... only the need to include traditional perspectives as an additional point of view on the subject. Better yet if they can look beyond literal interpretation of myths, etc. to see the wisdom of their perspective and incorporate those into their narrative and practice. ",Neutral,"This can be more specifically worded to include a prohibition on the long-term curation of cultural resources in archaeologists private property. We all know of instances where an archaeologist has died and their inheritors have refused to relinquish the artifacts, field notes, etc. in archaeologists' possession. It would also be good to include best practices, such as the fact that artifacts are best kept as close to where they were excavated as reasonably possible, to ensure access by descendant and local communities. This principle could be worded more strongly to say something like, short of an archaeologists' own writings on the subject, it is unethical for archaeologists to consider any part of the material record (including results of lab test, etc.) to their property. The idea of ownership of any part of the archaeological record is as unethical as any archaeologist claiming that they ""own"" the artifacts they've excavated. ",Neutral,"This could be worded more strongly to protect the locational information of archaeological sites. This would be in line with state and federal guidelines. I have found this publication to be a helpful resource on the matter: Linda R. Zellmer (2017) Protected Places: A Survey of Laws on Archaeological Site and Cave Location Confidentiality and Their Potential Impact on Library Reference Policies and Services, Journal of Map & Geography Libraries, 13:2, 148-174, DOI:
10.1080/15420353.2016.1249446
IT would also be good to take into account descendent communities' interests with regards to the distribution of sensitive information, including archaeological site locations, descriptions of culturally sensitive artifacts and practices, etc.",,"There have been too many sites excavated without being published at all. Archaeologists should be made accountable for this before they are allowed to continue their excavations. SAA should ask to see evidence of such publications before releasing research grants for the purposes of excavation, and should encourage other granting institutions to do likewise. 

Archaeologists should justify why previously-excavated archaeological sites are insufficient to answer their research questions before punching more holes in the ground. 

There should also be best practices on how to make sure that paper records aren't removed from artifact collections. There are too many orphaned collections out there, and we need to take steps to ensure that we aren't continuing to make the same kinds of choices that lead to this issue. ",Agree,"I struggle again here, as in other principles, by the fact that so much of the ethical burden (as it is represented) is placed on the victims of other people's neglect and selfishness. So many professors neglect to invest time in their graduate students, including with regard to their adequate training, which is usually justified by an attitude of ""if you're smart, you'll figure it out."" Additionally, the enormous costs of attending field school have resulted in fewer students getting sufficient opportunities to refine their field techniques. The costs of field schools also proportionately disadvantage low-income students,  perpetuating the low population of Historically Underrepresented Groups in archaeologists.  To remediate this issue, anthropology departments should be encourage students to participate in salvage excavation projects (ie, when data recovery is a must, not a whim), possibly even developing relationship with local land management agencies and CRM archaeologists to create apprenticeship programs to that end. Such experiences should be accepted as fulfilling field school undergraduate major requirements ",Neutral,"I don't like the way this principle is phrased in such a way that various types of harassment and discrimination are only unethical if there is a specific law against them. Also, there should be some means of holding perpetrators of harassment and discrimination accountable.

Air Force members are well versed in ethics across many fields and subjects. In addition to my profession, I am bound by my Native American ethics, which actually are strong than those of archaeologist. I say this with authority because we do have a need to collect artifacts and we have a stronger tie to land that allows us to see the entire area as a cultural resource versus the all too often statement ""...no cultural resources noted.""

I pride myself on the fact that I can go on a site survey and see more than any other archaeologist can see - it goes beyond ethics.","The primary concern is that archaeologist quickly state ""no cultural resources noted"" which it is not too.

Consider this:
Can you know someone upon a first meeting? Can you really know someone if you visited them twice in a year or does it get time to know a person?

Lesson:
An area that is survey will look different from year to year and season to season - some plants only bloom every few years or maybe every ten years, it is difficult even for me to comment on an area when it is being surveyed for development, but it is necessary to consider vegetation, history, visual landscapes and the overall holistic approach.

Secondly is the need to collect artifacts - it needs to stop. I have worked with the Public Lands Commission in California and requested that if artifacts need to be moved that California Transportation (CalTrans) allow the Native American community determine how, when and where to put them during a 4 lane highway extension.

Curation and study are not going to restore our heritage - curation creates a money and staffing problem for several agencies - why not allow Natives decided what happens to artifacts?",Strongly Disagree,"I disagree with older archaeologist all the time about their theories and ideas - how is it that they are the ones that decided what is important and what gets recorded?

I learned about ""lumpers"" and ""splitters"" just a few years ago... true stewardship would revolve around understanding how communities or sites work together and support a bigger picture rather than quickly recording sites and moving on - missing something bigger",Strongly Disagree,"Most of the Native American community that I know (its pretty big) has to push to be involved, even with 106 in place, and yet few still listen to us about our stories, ideas and knowledge",Agree,"Nothing should be collected anymore!

",Strongly Disagree,"Many Native Americans have shared stories, ideas and knowledge - the only way that their information should be share is with personal permission or that of their families and they should receive royalties and proper acknowledgement otherwise is theft and should be publishable.

It is because this has happened in our community that elders and even myself are reluctant to share because someone will alter the information, use it to get ahead or somehow profit from the information.",Strongly Agree,"All information needs to be safeguarded. In the Ownes Valley we still have ""pot hunters"" and ""treasure hunters"" that still seek graves and seek to destroy valuable sites.

I safeguard information from my tribe and only disclose what needs to be discussed for projects and to facilitate consultation at the general council level.",Strongly Agree,"Same, all information needs to be safeguarded and people seeking information or to even build on previous studies needs to be vetted prior to having access to information.

Our THPO's in the Owens Valley have a concern with people who are pursuing their PHD's or Masters Degree because they build on the work of others or think they are discovering something new - many people get a lot of stuff wrong at our expense",Strongly Agree,"Yes, they need tribal monitors with them who will give them advice on what to stay away from or how treat a particular site.

In our valley we have too many examples of how this goes wrong. During Data Recovery for the 395 Highway Expansion Project I asked for cadaver dogs to be used. The report came back and there is strong evidence that several areas have graves and are consistent with other indicators.

",Neutral,"I don't know enough about this to comment. I can say that at Nellis AFB, Nevada our Consolidated Groups and Tribes and Organizations (CGTO) consisting of 17 tribes from California, Nevada and Arizona meet twice a year with Air Force Officials.

We still have a long way to go in this regard and I would like to see indigenous rights at the forefront of a revised code of ethics. 

Bioarchaeological research presents a multitude of ethical concerns. The SAA should take a stance against studies such as Ancient DNA, skeletal isotopes, etc. which are conducted on human remains without the consent of and collaboration with relevant living communities. NAGPRA protects many Native American remains in the United States, but many more fall outside its purview. The potential legality of many such studies does not make them ethically sound. Furthermore, in much of Latin America and many other areas of the world, no such protections exist. In these cases, the code of ethics may be the only guidelines influencing these studies. Therefore it is important for the code of ethics to have strong guidance in this regard. 

Another ethical concern is challenging the myth of archaeological stewardship as a justification unto itself for archaeological research. Stewardship as a concept needs to be interrogated. I do not believe that this should be given primacy in our code of ethics. 

I think it should be stressed as an ethical imperative that we address the difficult social and political history of archaeology, especially its colonial origins and continued ties to colonial and capitalist practice when teaching archaeology to various publics and training new archaeologists. ",Disagree,"The phrasing of this statement implicitly creates a hierarchy where archaeological knowledge is at the top. Archaeologists often deal with other peoples' cultural heritage, and in these instances we should not be given the singular distinction of what happens to those cultural resources. It is grandiose to position ourselves as ""stewards"" of the archaeological record, when there are many, many communities with a vested interest in that record. Our ""specialized knowledge"" does not give us any inherent rights, though our chosen titles do come with responsibilities. We should be focused on practicing an archaeological which is socially and ethically sustainable. Also, we must question and address how conservation of the archaeological record is for the ""benefit of all people,"" when many would argue that our discipline has caused them harm. ",Agree,"This principle is too vague. In order for it to be more impactful, it needs to be expanded upon. ",Agree,,Strongly Agree,"As these principles are aspirational, we should mention that public education and outreach should be collaborative wherever possible.

Before 2016, I thought this was about physical safety because I had seen so many team leaders ignore good practice about weather, water, safe working with tools, adequate food and housing, reasonable ladders, accommodating the smaller bodies of women archaeologists when providing equipment, being willing to abide by OSHA guidelines for standing walls in excavations, vehicle safety, parasitic diseases transmitted or exacerbated by excavation. etc. That kind of stuff, that is intrinsic to doing archaeology, and the things that have killed archaeologists over the generations. 
Now, it seems like ""safety"" is a code word for avoiding sexual violence and racism. Aspects of sexual violence protections are protected by law, as are racial hate crimes. Universities have broad mandates to enforce Title IX even away from the U.S. as a matter of protecting students involved in educational activities. I have thought a lot about this and feel like treating this as sexual violence only means that it ignores power differentials of several types that are intrinsic to education, to scientific research, and to work life generally. When a person is harassed or assaulted in the field or in a hotel by someone strong enough to overcome them, or armed, perhaps, it's bad but not all this behavior is illegal.

If violations occur on public lands or under federal permits, the federal government agencies may need to be involved.

I consulted several other organization's rules to inform myself.,"The problem of racial and gender discrimination in the discipline and the organizaitons that employ archaeologists.

The problem of the protection of archaeological sites from damage or destruction.

The problem of making sure to respect the rights of Native Americans and other indigenous people to sites and objects from sites.

The need to protect and preserve unpublished documentary, digital, and object materials from archaeological investigations for future research.",Neutral,"I'm not sure what the next few questions will contain, but I wanted to mention here the need for a statement about how the institutions and businesses that employ archaeologists and the agencies that fund their field research also need to take responsibility for the preservation of the collections that came out of the research.  I've worked for or collaborated with a number of institutions that refused to take responsibility for the curation of the collections from my research.  As a result, I, personally, am storing important research collections in my basement, a place that is not adequate in terms of conservation either of documents (labels) or objects.  Even some of the countries I've done research in have refused to curate collections sometimes, and when they have received them the treatment they accorded the collections led to their damager or destruction.  In one case, careless smoking by local staff in a country led to a fire that destroyed collections and in another inadequate curation of a collection maintained on the site in a country resulted in all paper (labels, containers) being easten by termites. ",Neutral,"I also think that the results of archaeological work need to be disseminated by ourselves as widely as possible in order to inform and make available our material to persons or groups who can benefit from the information.  An example that comes to mind is a situation in a country where I was doing research, where local indigenous groups were being told that they had no history or heritage in the area, which at the time was being despoiled and indigenous people displaced by an organization that had falsified its application for an access permit. But the wrong information that purported to say that the indigenous people had no historic connection or rights to be there and be involved in governance was being promoted by the government of the country.  We researchers were able to show the local indigenous group slides of the archaeology and ethnihistory of the area that documented the strong evidence that the local group had been there for thousands of years and that the majority population of the country had only been there a few hundred years at most.  The lack of basic education on the history and archaeology of the area limited people's recognition of their rights and that limited their role in the preservation of the landscape of of their culture and population.",Neutral,"But, I feel that information should always be preserved and dissseminated, even when that requires study of material that has been improperly removed from its site of origin.  In my experience, gaining the maximum information possible by that engagement has make possible mitigations and prevention of future such removals. So, I would not be favorable to any precept that would caution archaeologists to eschew the gathering of information about objects from the illegal or improper trade in archaeological materials.",Neutral,"I feel that something should be added to this wording to emphasize that archaeologists should not criticize other archaeologists for popularizing archaeological information. There's a history of sneering at those who choose to write popular accounts, as if those are less worthy academically.  But if it's a priority to disseminate our information as broadly as possible, then we should be promoting the popularization of it.  If the statement on ethics were to say outright that this is a kind of dissemination that should be privileged because it contributes to the furtherance of our priorities I think it might discourage the dismissal of popularizers. ",Neutral,"Usually, in my experience, the countries where archaeologists work require archaeologists to file reports and records promptly with some relevant organization, such as a partrimony agency.  Then, anyone can ask to see those records.  However, I occasionally have run into a situation where a repository feels obliged to refuse to post publicly materials that a researcher has donated because of some feeling that access should be limited to individual researchers.  The Center for Research Libraries has refused to post publicly transcriptions of a particular researcher's transcripts and translations of records of accounts of an indigenous society, even though the researcher is now dead. The records are extremely important in establishing the existence of highly organized heterarchical societies before colonization, a finding that would very much benefit the descendants of those societies who are dealing with inaccurate and possibly disingenuous information from some groups of western researchers.  It would be good to include something about the need for repositories to make indigenous materials as publicy available as possible when there is no compleling reason why they should be restricted. ",Neutral,"I feel that it is often difficult to get publishers to agree to publish results in ways that allow the inclusion of specific factual evidence, such as stratigraphic profiles, pottery sherd pictures and profiles, or narratives of excavation results.  Archaeologists can certainly post their unpublished reports or file them in archives but I feel that there should be some other arrangement that could provide for the publication of such unglamorous materials in ways that would be relatively lasting.  Since publishing is now much cheaper and easier with digital methods, perhaps the policy should mention that the institutions involved in sponsoring the research or curating the collections should take responsibility for making printed and pictorial results available publicly in lasting forms. ",Neutral,"I feel that there is a problem in the way researchers handle skeletal and botanical collections that leads to the loss of information and deterioration of the specimens.  I have seen archaeologists directly handle, break in order to see the interiod of something, and neglect to replace material in its labeled container with the result that the provenience is lost and the integrity of the specimens is harmed. So, in this part of the policy there should be a statement added that archaeologists and other researchers such as physical anthropologists and botanists who study archaeological collections need to adhere to handling methods that conform to good conservation principles and expressly avoid doing harm to the material that would limit the effectiveness of its curation and make it less useful for future research. ",Neutral,I think that the SAA should try to assist archaeologists or researchers in related fields to get good advice on how to properly and adequately handle data sampling and handling of material.,Neutral,"I recognize that the problematic situations that were allowed to exist in the 1970s and 1980s may be less common nowadays, but perhaps the statement in the policy should be more specific.  It still seems to be the case that not a few researchers look at field work as a way to express yourself or find yourself romantically or sexually, and both students and local people in fieldwork situations stand in a subaltern relationship with foreign scientists, especially men but not only men.  It is still common for a researcher to form a relationship with a subaltern person that is by definition unequal.  These relationships often end with the end of the field season but even when they do not, the relationships often break up when the student of local person has difficulty adapting to life in the sphere of the researcher.  In any case, people who make these relationships often do not look at the social stratification aspect and don't consider what their effect is on the other person.  Something in the policy that acknowledges social inequality and the needd to protect ""inferiors"" from harm in unequal relationships might be good.",Neutral,"I've marked neutral in all my responses in order to suggest that the policy could be more specific and more congnizant of the situations of possible harm to people, information, objects, and sites of researchers and institutions actions or non-actions. ",Neutral,I've indicated in earlier responses that they are not adequate.,Neutral,I've indicated in my prior responses the things I feel could be more specific and farther reaching in the policy. ,Yes,"I think I've mentioned most of my concerns in my previous responses.

Compare/contrast for teaching purposes in my Public Archaeology course","Tough question, as I believe we have internal professional ethical concerns and out-ward facing ""beyond the profession"" concerns. The SAA Principles (in the 1990s) were mostly about internal issues before, but now have been incorporating/thinking about effect beyond the profession.

I think we need nuanced balance. These are complicated issues and the one thing in teaching them is that students tend to knee-jerk into right/wrong answers. When it comes to SOME of the SAA Principles, I think we need to discuss why we have these in place, but then also give room for debate, re-interpretation, and evolution over time. I know that is what the task force is taking into consideration.  I strongly support the addition of the workplace ethics statements, which is relatively new, and support more language on sexual harassment and assault.

However, the framing of archaeologists as ""stewards"" is a little narrow and potentially self-serving. I think it is more important to consider how different peoples approach the archaeological record. Indigenous peoples may think of themselves as ""caretakers,"" which is far more robust than ""stewards"" - my point isn't that archaeologists should be caretakers, too, but that as professionals we need to think of the complex social dynamics and interests at play. 

Likewise, is preserving heritage essential in every cultural context, or does it reflect a specific cultural framework with specific metaphysical anxieties about oblivion? Should statues of confederate generals be preserved, and what kinds of social spaces get opened up as these ""heritage"" objects and monuments to white supremacy are taken down?

Historically in the US, ""stewardship"" has meant the appropriation of ancestral Native American bodies and material culture in colonial institutions, so I think this principle needs to be reevaluated and rewritten. ",Agree,"I think this is an important principle, although it could be stronger. The language of ""affected group(s)"" is also a bit vague. Is everyone equally important in these considerations, and should they be? For example, if we're talking about a space that is contested between a Native American nation and an oil company, should archaeologists be concerned with ""establishing a working relationship that can be beneficial to all parties involved?"" That's an extreme example, and maybe a bit black and white, but I hope it clarifies my meaning. 

",Agree,"Again, this is an important issue. However, I am a little concerned by the way it assumes archaeologists are the proper owners of ""cultural resources"" or ""the archaeological record"" - I work in North America, so the history here is of settlers claiming ancestral Native American bodies and material culture. ",Strongly Agree,"This is an extremely important principle to me. However, the framing favors a unilateral model of outreach as opposed to collaboration, in which archaeologists communicate expert knowledge to a lay public. A truly cooperative effort would go beyond this. I think that any archaeologist who works with descendant peoples will tell you, we learn far more rich and powerful information from community members than we can ever really reciprocate. Particularly important to consider here are how archaeologists should engage with multiple ways of knowing, including oral traditions. 

Likewise, should archaeologists seek to enlist the support of Indigenous publics (for example) for the stewardship of the archaeological record, or should non-native archaeologists learn from Indigenous caretaking practices?",Agree,"I think this should be made stronger. Maybe I'm wrong, but basically I read this as saying that researchers can maintain primary access to their materials for a while, so they can receive due credit through publications, but the ultimate goal is eventual open access. This is worth stating explicitly, and ties back to the previous principle about public education and accessible information. Some universities offer funds to publish open access - maybe its worth calling for this to become more widespread and better funded? On the other hand, there are a number of complexities here - I know I certainly don't have the knowledge to create a public database of my materials.

However, not all information is appropriate for open access. Again, my expertise is in Indigenous contexts, where some information is not appropriate for certain outsiders or social groups. I know sociolinguistics have developed databases for public projects in which users have limited access to materials on the basis of things like clan and gender.",Agree,"I have the same question as my earlier statement that not all information is appropriate for all audiences. However, is a potentially underfunded archive or even the attics of community leaders a ""suitable place for permanent safekeeping""? I think that if there is a descendant community interested in claiming the materials, they should have the primary claim - although I understand that would be an extremely complex determination in many cases). But the alternative is reproducing colonial relations in which Indigenous materials are unilaterally claimed as national heritage. Of course, many tribes have excellent museums and preservation capacities, and many might prefer objects to be kept in a university or museum with those capacities, but I think these are issues that the SAA needs to tackle head on.",Agree,"This is an important value. However, it is again a bit universalizing - while naturalizing archaeologists as the sole proprietor of cultural resources. ",Strongly Agree,I think this is essential. I would encourage the Task Force to take it further and state that archaeologists should receive training in research with descendant communities. ,Strongly Agree,"I thing the segment on harassment should be made stronger, or even given its own principle in addition to the language in here. Framing this in terms of following laws is a bit of a disservice, I think - particularly when law enforcement is notoriously bad at enforcing these laws, particularly in communities of color. Anyway, harassment is unethical, regardless of existing laws, and ""passing the buck"" in this way is a bit of a punt in my opinion.",Disagree,"I think the existing Principles are good within a very narrow scope - of outlining a fairly self-serving vision of preserving the archaeological record for archaeologists. I don't mean that those considerations aren't important, just that they're narrow.

I think there needs to be more attention to community-based archaeology and archaeology that works with descendent communities. In that vein, I think more attention needs to be given to the specifically colonial and postcolonial political contexts that archaeology is conducted within. Trying to frame ethics in more neutral terms that leaves these power relations unnamed only re-inscribes normatively colonial and settler vantage points. As it stands, the Principles of Ethics normalizes archaeologists as the natural proprietors of the archaeological record - a state of affairs solidified in the 1906 American Antiquities Act as it classified Indigenous remains as national heritage - in a way that obscures the more complex and contested politics of who owns the past.

Likewise, I think the segment on harassment - and discrimination - needs to be expanded. In particular, the ongoing structural racism, colonialism, sexism, and classism in academic universities, as well as micro-aggressions, should be discussed explicitly. In this sense, I would take the review of the Principles of Ethics as an opportunity to frame a system of ethics for creating a discipline and practice of archaeology that better serves marginalized and historically underrepresented communities. For example, archaeology is not an especially diverse field - and I think we have an ethical responsibility to look at the systematic mechanisms that reproduce that situation and change them.",Disagree,"I work within the US, which is a settler state. The Principles as they stand simply do not engage in the politics of archaeology in a settler state in any systematic or deep way. It is not especially responsible to Indigenous perspectives or claims. ",Disagree,"Again, the Principles are good at addressing issues within a narrow scope of preservation and expert knowledge. I always work to help my students understand why these considerations do matter, although they (rightly I think) tend to take issue with the erasure of Indigenous perspectives and claims. ",Yes,See previous statements.,3,1,4,5,2,"An aspirational code,A living document","I see how separate principles and standards could be useful, in terms of saying, ""here's the bare minimum of ethical archaeology,"" and ""here's what we should be striving to do"".",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,

does this mean:

- 'affected group' as defined by the individual archaeologist?
- as defined by their client?
- as self-defined by outside individuals, groups or agencies? [if this, then this becomes never-ending and the archaeologist cannot be sure that the list of affected groups is complete, and so they cannot consult actively with them]",Neutral,"Generally, yes, this is right.

It needs a refresh.",Strongly Disagree,"Not every project is a public outreach project.

This is is limited to IP ""created through the study of archaeological resources"" - members create IP that is generated from other activities.
This principle does not protect the work the archaeologist has done - indeed, quite the opposite.
I think this conflicts with current best practice and needs to be completely reconsidered.",Disagree,"Not adequate, because the primary responsibility is to the client. If no public money has gone in to a project, then I'm sorry, but the public has no right to use its results for whatever reason they see fit. 
This is a good aspiration, and archaeologists should seek to ensure that such provisions are in any contracts they sign - but if they cannot get this in the binding agreements they have with their clients (or employers) - then it is not up to the archaeologist to put things into the public domain when they dont have the right to do that.",Agree,this is ok,Disagree,"This is too weak.

An archaeologist must ensure that they are competent to undertake the work they are planning

These things -

are not measures of competence. They support competence, but they do not demonstrate competence",Disagree,"""laws and policies of their home nation and institutional workplace""

As director of the state's division of archaeology and very involved in SHPO practices, we occasionally refer to ethical standards in discussions of data access, consultation, and best practices.","Being transparent about what your, or your project, is doing with all the relevant parties, and doing so in way that makes them actual participants and not someone you talk to after everything is decided..  Not really a problem for most 106 projects as that process usually (!) manages to include the right players in a timely way.  But I think archaeologists still have a significant challenge consulting with tribal communities on non-106 projects.  There is still a strong tendency to develop the project scope and plan of operation before reaching out to other possible partners and asking them to join.  This doesn't provide them the opportunity to join in the development and help make the project what they want it to be.
At the same time, while my current role is telling archaeologists how they can meet the SHPO's expectations while accommodating tribal expectations as well, if I were to develop my own personal research project (retirement?), I would certainly let the appropriate Tribes know of my plans, but I am not sure how I would react if one or more of them had significant concerns about the proposal.  Certainly would talk with them about it, but at what level am i willing to give them veto power over what I do - no answer to this (yet).

One of the standard phrases in 106 is 'making a reasonable and good faith effort'.  it is not always clear what that should entail.  While our office has developed field and report standards as one means to address that, you can't cover every situation.  what are the ethical implications of this standard?
Where I run into this often is in dealing with unmarked and abandoned cemeteries.  What level of effort is 'right' when trying to find descendent communities who should participate in decisions impacting their ancestors graves (tribal, slave, or other).  Especially in the case of slave or 19th century rural family cemeteries where there is no obvious descendent population?
I often find myself thinking of the 'reasonable and good faith' standard as essentially coming down to ""can I defend my actions in court"".  Have never been called into court to defend, but this is how i often find myself assessing the effort.  Is the fear of court a reasonable ethical standard to use?",Strongly Agree,"my only concern is that the way it is worded seems to imply that archaeologists are the ones that 'control' the archaeological record, and that fails to acknowledge that other parties have an equal interest and ownership, and that preservation/protection should require working with those communities in a mutual preservation effort.  But the statement does capture what I think archaeologists should be responsible for.",Agree,"the challenge here is what is meant by 'consult with'.

You might just as well replace most of the earlier principles by citing the antiquities act and leaving it there. It's not enough to just say this is covered elsewhere. The ethics of personal responsibility and safe environments needs to be clearly spelled out. This principle should stand on its own as a standard to hold each of us to. When someone violates it, that should be clear from the way the principle is written. As it is now, it seems like a placeholder that shifts responsibility to the legal system. SAA needs to be able to sanction members who don't follow ethical standards separately from whether they are technically legal or not. It's probably not technically illegal to take 30 years to report on an excavation, but the ethics of those situations are clear here. This should be the same. Contributing to a work environment that causes subordinates to feel unsafe needs to be specifically prohibited, and those who do so should be held to account whether or not their actions accord with ""the laws and policies of their home nation.""

In reality American Archaeologist working in academia are encouraged to take young and inexperienced students to exotic locales for fieldwork. Any 'data' recovered is horded by the directors and used to advanced that institutions viewpoint, like voting for your favorite theory through manipulation of the publishing system (see Bintliff, 2011). I wish American archaeologists were more up front concerning the embedded status of academia within the Capitalist socio-economic system. Even worse, the shady situational ethics of Survivor Island have infected academia like cancer. Every month a new scandal rocks the social sciences [Niall Ferguson's fall from Harvard's graces over petty departmental social warfare, fabricated spider data, published papers 'recalled' 'voluntarily' by suddenly ethical researchers and so on]. ",Agree,"I agree that many different parties have stakes in archaeological research. I have worked at some well-known (hence, profitable) archaeological sites and found myself embroiled in local politics several times. This is an interesting point, but a complex conundrum on the ground. I remember excavating monuments that later went to a local museum, only to have the central government send trucks to move the monuments to the capital, 900km away. I did not want to monuments to make the journey and saw the protests at the museum when locals demanded that their cultural patrimony remain local. The archaeologists in charge of the recoveries were never consulted, which led to more animosity. There were different cultural groups speaking different languages, local and federal officials making constant demands [grifts and grafts] etc. This reality was never covered in any book or class at any university I attended. ",Strongly Agree,"Again, American Archaeology is embedded with the Capitalist system and must abide by those rules, stated or understood. This survey is looking a bit naive at this point. Of course, archaeologists should not profiteer, though I doubt reading an ethics statement will bring morality back to the profession. ",Neutral,,Agree,"I agree, but this will not occur without extreme pressure to change the existing academic model.

These folks often put their agenda before their mid-range theory and academic rigor.  They also diminish the profession by making all these claims about what archaeology can and must do.  They inevitably fail.  Having said archaeology must be activism or it is nothing at all, having failed to solve any major world problem (have failed in their activism), where does that leave the profession?  How do we justify archaeology when so many are preaching that only activist archaeology counts?  The half-assed liberalism -- I can solve the world problems of mass migration by synthesizing archaeological studies of migration, or I can make racism go away by proclaiming myself an activist archaeologist or I can eliminate world sexism by donning my Activist Archaeology cape -- is dangerous and leads to poor archaeology.  It also oversells what archaeology can and should do, and that sets us up for the weakening or elimination of Section 106 and such.

In the first go round of the Ethical Principles--there was not a principle of scholarship and integrity. I have always found that to be a glaring oversight given it is a basic tenant of the education we all received, but never explicitly enshrined in the principles.

There are still inherent inequities in the academy, in agencies, and in other organizations where archaeologists work.

For social and political reasons I think that accountability should be every archaeologists' primary ethical concern. Anthropology and archaeology are colonial fields in the United States, the power dynamics are not even, and it is up to archaeologists to be aware of the destructive nature of our science and how that affects other groups (especially indigenous groups).
For the field/science itself I think that stewardship and public education/outreach are primary ethical concerns. Stewardship on all fronts would be improved if all archaeologists were invested in public education and outreach (I'm thinking in particular of in situ archaeological protection and conservation). I also believe that not enough archaeologists are invested in the long-term protection of the archaeological record after it has been dug up.... collection management is something that all of us should be invested in. ",Neutral,I think that this principle could be made more explicit when it comes to the ethical obligation of archaeologists to plan for and implement long-term collections care. ,Disagree,"I think that this principle very much reads as if it is from 1996 and doesn't go far enough to address the ethical implications of archaeological work on affected groups who have less power in our society. The first principle of the American Anthropological Association is ""Do no harm."" That principle explicitly states ""Anthropologists should not only avoid causing direct and immediate harm but also should weigh carefully the potential consequences and inadvertent impacts of their work. When it conflicts with other responsibilities, this primary obligation can supersede the goal of seeking new knowledge and can lead to decisions to not undertake or to discontinue a project."" 
I don't think it is unreasonable for this to be a principle for the SAA as well. After-all how are we going to be able to engage with other ethical principles like stewardship, outreach, etc. if we have burned all our bridges?",Strongly Agree,,Agree,"I think that if we actually care about any of the other principles education and public outreach are imperative. I think it is a bit of a cop out to imply that archaeologists are ""unable to undertake public education and outreach directly."" There are so many ways to do public outreach/education, and I think it should be a priority for every archaeologist to engage with this in some way (not saying that everyone needs to be giving this their all one hundred percent of the time, but they shouldn't be let off the hook when it comes to thinking about and engaging with this in some way).",Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Agree,I think this principle is hugely important and should be given more weight.

As we have seen, sexual harassment is a major problem, but we have done very little to address it. Why? The inability to support and enforce our ethics is a real problem. Ethics mean nothing if there is no enforcement mechanism. As far as I can tell there has been no reduction in sexual harassment after including it in the Principles. So, how do you give it ""teeth""? It is a major problem for the discipline. I don't feel comfortable encouraging my students to go into the field and can only encourage them to go certain field schools (mostly because I know the directors or they have very clear statements AND mechanisms for addressing harassment). IFR is also no longer one of them, which means that there is almost no centralized field school tool. This is all because of a general ethics malaise that has infiltrated the field because we cannot ensure that our own ethics are being followed. ",Agree,"Stewardship is not just about the archaeological record. I would like to see something added about how ""good relationships"" (better terms needed) with communities is a type of ""stewardship"" because it enables the protection of sites. BTW I recognize that this is in subsequent principles, but these are hierarchical (most everything falls under 1). Bringing this into principle one stresses that our endeavor is not just about protecting things. ",Strongly Agree,,Agree,"I would change the wording of this to include some statement that would include companies (e.g. Christies or Hobby Lobby). This stresses ""personal enjoyment or profit"" but I don't think that companies or museums fall under that statement. Let's say Christies sells objects to a museum, that would not fall under this Principle and yet, it certainly promotes commercialization.

",Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Disagree,"This should be stronger. It really passes all responsibility off and says that people should follow the law. Well, duh. That's not exactly an ethical statement. It needs to be specific and make a clear statement against sexual harassment, gender-based harassment (and bias), and so much more.

However, there is a crisis of expertise at the moment - pseudoarchaeology is pervasive, and the interpretation of archeological evidence by unqualified individuals has led and continues to lead to the production of misleading, damaging, or irresponsible narratives.

AAA","As someone who works in CRM,  the ""race to the bottom"" has been my primary concern. Firms low-balling bids to get work and then not having the proper funds to complete the work to standards so they don't. We don't see the local, state, or federal agencies holding these firms to the standards and calling them out for blatantly not meeting them. It is devastating to see the poor work from these firms allowing the destruction of important cultural resources. It is frustrating to watch sites that we have recorded and know will be significant given to these firms, who charge half the cost, for further study and immediately deem these sites insignificant to please the client. And it is even more frustrating that these same companies become a joke among other firms for the poor quality of their work, and yet agencies, at all levels, continue to do nothing. 
Exacerbating this situation is the lack of funding in general that pushes the field to use volunteers to do what should be considered skilled tasks. And while I love and sincerely appreciate the work that volunteers do and realize that some will come to know more than many trained professionals, that is the exception. We devalue our education, training, and expertise when we use volunteers to do a majority of the work because we are not given funding. And we encourage continued under funding by promising we can find volunteers to do the same work for free. 
The lack of funding and use of volunteers also means that field techs can be treated as disposable...people to be worked until they break for low pay, temporary employment, and no benefits. All of these issues contribute to the continued ""race to the bottom"" that does a disservice to our entire field by eroding the trust of the clients who wonder why one firm can do what they see as the same work for much less and with better result (no further work needed); the agencies, with whom we must negotiate the least amount of work for the least amount of money for those clients; and the public, who expects us to protect cultural resources.",Strongly Agree,,Agree,,Agree,,Agree,,Agree,,Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Agree,,Agree,,Agree,,No opinion/Not sure,,5,1,4,3,2,Ethical document(s) that more fully addresses concerns in my sector/region of work,see previous comment about the race to the bottom in CRM.,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- Inadequate data sharing and transparency in research methods (e.g. providing databases to back up published results).

- Lack of accountability for project directors, crew chiefs, professors, etc. who sexually harass, bully, and/or abuse subordinates in the context of archaeological work.

- Wage stagnation and general poor treatment of entry-level workers within the context of cultural resource management.

- Lack of transparency and accountability within the SAA itself.",Agree,I think this principle is adequate in concept. It could stand to be more vigorously pursued.,Disagree,"This principle is inadequate in modern archaeology. In its wording, it privileges the archaeologist and puts other stakeholders (e.g. indigenous communities) in second place. What if the archaeologist feels they have acted in good faith but a beneficial working relationship has not been established for all parties? Are they free to proceed in good ethical standing? The principle would seem to say yes. In my own practice we do not operate this way; we do not take what is not freely given. But I know that there are some archaeologists who act as if they are the arbiters of what is right in this regard and that have proceeded against the wishes of other stakeholders in their work. ",Strongly Disagree,"This principle is not strong enough. There are still some archaeologists who find excuses to work with looters and looted collections. More generally, members of the art collecting and museum world continue to defend looting in various mediums, including newspaper editorials, interviews, etc. Those who defend or allowed or enable looting should be shunned from archaeology. The SAA should state that looting is destruction of cultural heritage and will not be condoned in any manner.",Agree,This principle is fine as written. It's poorly implemented in practice.,Disagree,"Another one that too few archaeologists actually follow, and for which there is too little enforcement by journals. It should also be amended for the digital era; in addition to the knowledge and documents created through the study of archaeological resources, it should include those tools designed and created to effect that study, where relevant. For instance, the GIS analyses, statistical tools, scripts, code, etc. used to derive published results should be made available. This is already standard practice in many ""hard"" science fields, most notably biology. In a timely note, the COVID19 crisis has provided many examples where the required publication of supporting data showed that the research and conclusions coming from some sources was simply of poor quality or erroneous. It would be interesting indeed to have this degree of transparency in archaeological research publications.",Disagree,"Again, a nice thought. Compliance and enforcement is laughable in the academic context, somewhat better in CRM. Perhaps defining ""within a reasonable time"" more clearly would be a good start. Tangentially, data might be more readily disseminated if the community were more open to the publication of negative results (a problem in all scientific publishing).",Neutral,"Once again, this is adequate as a statement. In my own experience, perhaps 1/3 of archaeologists view collections as ""theirs"" and treat them accordingly, the other 2/3 more or less follow these guidelines. What recourse is there within the framework of the SAA for those 1/3? I have reported individuals who mishandled or destroyed collections materials to appropriate authorities (government, curators, etc.) and, in a collections role, have refused access to individuals who failed to exercise proper care in the past. But it never occurred to me to bring any of these incidents up with SAA because these are only principles, and the organization is completely toothless.",Disagree,"""...and they must make the utmost effort to deploy those resources to the fullest extent possible during the course of said research; to do otherwise is a dereliction of professional responsibility.""

It is not enough to have materials on hand; one must use them. I could provide numerous examples, especially in CRM contexts, where archaeologists declined to use the full resources available to them to do good archaeology, because it was easier/faster/cheaper to do a subpar job. Anyone involved in CRM can name at least one group in their region that commonly operates in this manner; these organizations should be held to account. ",Disagree,"Again, this is a nice idea. We can all think of many examples within the discipline where it is not followed in practice. What is the consequence, in the context of the SAA, for violating this principle? 

Perhaps this (and the previous 8 principles) should be amended to state that those who are aware of such activity on the part of others and tolerate it or fail to speak out, are also complicit. In my own research area, it is common knowledge which project directors commit sexual harassment, bully their graduate students, ignore student and worker safety, and so on. Some people are honest about it but others prefer to remain silent, or pretend the problem does not exist.",Disagree,"- Lack of sufficient duty of care in most points.

- Lack of consequences.

- Outdated in regards to technical advancements.

- Inadequate for archaeology as a profession. I recognize that there are many non-professional archaeologists involved in the SAA; perhaps we need separate codes of ethics. I recognize that the RPA exists; nobody I know cares about them (and in fact I have had multiple archaeologists tell me they regard the RPA as a joke). The SAA is the premiere archaeological organization in the Americas and it needs to take ownership of standards of conduct and practice for archaeology accordingly.

",Disagree,"Again, no duty of care and no consequences. These are not standards, they are guidelines. There are a fair number of archaeologists who do a poor job of following them, or flagrantly disregard them. Since there is no mechanism for compliance, reporting, or enforcement, they are just nice suggestions. That is a legitimate way to approach things, but then the SAA can't pretend to be the voice and representative of responsible archaeology.

I used them for publication and to discuss ethical issues with colleagues","It's hard to limit myself to on primary ethical concern, so I've listed my top concerns in no particular order:

Accessibility: It has become evident to me that archaeology is not always accessible to a variety of stakeholder, particular indigenous and historically marginalized groups, to low-income students, and people with disabilities. I have a lower middle class background and while I was able to pay for my fieldschool, it was a financial burden. This seems to be the case for many, and there are many others who would like to pursue fieldschools but can't due to the cost. I think there needs to be a concerted effort to fund training for individuals interested in archaeology but can't afford the costs associated with traditional archaeological fieldschools/training.

Safe working environment: After last year's SAA meetings, the recent story about the Harvard Anthropology department, and numerous other examples it has become widely known that there is an issue of sexual harassment and abuse within archaeology. I do think this is changing as more people have become aware of it, but this seems to be a long-standing issue in archaeology, tied particularly to the hierarchical power structure of academia and field research. 

Merging engagement and scientific research: I personally see archaeology as a scientific endeavor. However, this does not mean that I think archaeology is apolitical, or mutually exclusive from collaborative/engaged archaeology and working with native communities. However, there seems to be rift developing where archaeologists either have to be fully immersed and dedicated to engagement, or objective scientists that do have little to no interaction with native groups. I do not think there needs to be such a stark divide. This pertains especially to ancient DNA. I think it is possible to conduct ancient DNA studies that are both scientifically grounded and meet ethical standards for working with human remains   ",Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Agree,,Neutral,"I am an advocate for open science, so I personally think there needs to be more emphasis here on making archaeological data and knowledge public within a reasonable amount of time. I think it's perfectly acceptable for archaeologists to keep information private prior to publication. However, once published data should be made as accessible as possible. Archaeologists also need to publish or share their data in reasonable time frame! It is unacceptable to keep research unpublished for 10 years (or more), as we all know horror stories of sites not being reported, artifacts lost, etc.  ",Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Neutral,"I think this statement could be stronger. As I mentioned in my primary ethical concerns about the field response, it is clear that feeling safe in the field, office, lab, etc. is an issue for many (especially women).

I also had a scholar tell me that I was their stealing research since they wrote one report on the subject in 2007 but I was writing my thesis in 2015 and was elaborating on their research and giving them credit throughout. I believe an emphasis should be placed on scholars releasing their reports within a given time period and that it is unethical to allow scholars to view unpublished work when they request it. I also believe that there should be a bigger emphasis placed on the section about archaeological documents & reports are part of the archaeological record and should not be viewed as a personal possession.

",Agree,"Strongly agree stewardship is important, but also needs to consider value of living people over their records, that archaeology is not done to the detriment of the cultures we study, and done in the spirit of collaboration and partnership.  Also needs to recognize stewardship done in partnership with citizens or descendent communities, include them in the definition of who is doing archaeology and who is broadly responsible for stewardship. ",Strongly Agree,I like this one- needs to explicity state what is likely assumed under all levels of professional activity- that publication and dissemination of results is shared. ,Agree,"I feel language can be stronger. Affiliation with terrorist groups and the law enforcement component is so important. So many advances have been made in archaeologists working with law enforcement, training in what to look for, long term participation in investigations that uncover small and large scale operations. ""carefully weigh"" changed to stronger language- don't do it, don't be part of it, don't encourage it. Essential to many of the television programs that archaeologists involved are not allowed or encouraged to participate as it violates their professional code of ethics. ",Agree,"All archaeologists should undertake these activities. Supporting efforts of others is fine but a way many get out of doing it. Public benefit of archaeology should be done for all, by all. Advocacy is important, but scientific literacy, informing local decision making processes, impacting social issues through archaeology- more than just making a poster or brochure. And enlist public support for stewardship is great- but enlist the public as stewards, make more active, would strengthen this principle. ",Disagree,"I agree with the principle but it does not adequarly apply to intellectual property issues today.Just as it's listed there should be a compelling reason to restrict access, I hope it can be balanaced by a compelling or reasonable reason to request the data. We go down lots of rabbit holes to share, when there was no research question or proposal that laid out why the data was needed. It would be interesting to hear more on this topic as something aligned to best practices or case by case examples could show more what to consider. Where a living document might serve this principle better than aspirational. ",Disagree,"I strongly agree this is important but it does not apply to challenges today. Wide arrange of publications- that's certainly not the case. I also think this needs serious examination as sites are being destroyed and impacted by climate change at a more rapid rate- a living document to deal with balancing site location sensitivity with the fact many sites won't be around the next season. ""An interest"" is made law in many states, where it's no longer appropriate, to the detriment of public awareness of site destruction not by looting. ",Disagree,"I agree, but we are faced with a curation crisis that is difficult to balance with this ethic. A living document would help as the situation is rapidly changing and de-accession policies are emerging. ",Disagree,"I agree in principle but there is such broad interpretation of adequate training. We don't have a student teaching requirement like teachers do before they go out and command classrooms. Who decides what is adequate- how do they change regionally? Facilities is a good one- without a proper lab to process what they are collecting, this one is used freqently where I work and helps to get the resources to address this need ",Disagree,"It's a great statement, but this has been the greatest failure of our discipline to say it is adequately addressed.

",Agree,"It's a nice principle but not detailed enough to actually mean much. It doesn't help with questions like how much of a site to dig, how an archaeologist can balance their duty to the archaeological record with their work on a pipeline or highway, whether we should avoid excavation in some cases, whether it's ethical to start digging without having a long-term curation plan, whether research can be ethical when it involves dealing with landowners who are doing unethical excavations or with museums that are skirting NAGPRA. ",Disagree,"Again, it's fine as a general principle but doesn't really say much. What is a reasonable effort, who are affected groups? Is a reasonable effort more than the bare minimum required by law? Also why is the goal to establish a working relationship rather than something stronger?",Agree,This one is so important and I actually think it's pretty specific and well-written.

Examined for policies regarding NAGPRA and repatriation of Native American ancestral human remains and funerary objects. 
","-repatriation
-true partnerships with descendant communities (decolonizing anthropology)
-sexual harassment and assault issues (IFR issues, Harvard professors, the list goes on and on). 
-curation and collections management (the curation crisis)",Disagree,"While the ideals of stewardship listed here are important, they also reinforce the idea that archaeologists know best/ know more than local descendant communities, particularly Native Americans.  

""Stewards are both caretakers of and advocates for the archaeological record for the benefit of all people;"" - not all sites should be excavated or shared with all people.  The overarching ""cultural heritage for all' argument discredits Native American knowledge and expertise. Burial sites should not be disturbed. Ancestral remains and funerary, sacred and patrimonial objects should be returned to the appropriate descendant community(ies).  

Archaeologists need to set up partnerships with descendant tribes - real partnerships, not just lip-service.  Archaeologists are not the only stewards of the past, and they need to acknowledge and lift up voices other than their own.  ",Disagree,"This needs to be a stronger statement about working with descendant communities from the beginning - the initial planning stage of a project.  Not at the end or a brief notification.

In addition, it is beyond frustrating to hear bioarchaeologists say, ""well, I don't work in the US, so NAGPRA doesn't apply, and I don't know much about it."" NAGPRA (repatriation, tribal involvement)  touches on a major ethical accountability foci within the field of archaeology, and needs to be a standard part of training, whether academic, CRM or amateur.  ",Disagree,"This is an important statement - but is something I was never taught in my studies of archaeology, from BA to MA to PHD.  I have never heard a colleague talk about a time when they did this (chose not to do a project because of commercial impact). I have heard many more stories, both in the US and abroad, where armed guards were hired to protect sites because of valuable objects (or rumors of valuable objects).  

While I agree with the statement, I am struggling with it, because it is something that I do not see practiced or discussed in the field.  How can the SAA, as the national organization, do more to support this ethical aspiration? ",Disagree,"This is a highly problematic sentence:  ""Many publics exist for archaeology including students and teachers; Native Americans and other ethnic, religious, and cultural groups who find in the archaeological record important aspects of their cultural heritage; lawmakers and government officials; reporters, journalists, and others involved in the media; and the general public."" 

Archaeologists should not be ""telling"" a Native community their history.  They should be partnering with descendant communities to creative collaborative, community-based projects that benefit the community, not just the academic's career or a federal or state agency's project timeline.  

Public outreach should be an even more integral part of archaeology.  Why does it matter? Who are we helping? ",Disagree,"I think there are more facets of intellectual property that need to be addressed here.
-Not all research should be public. This goes well beyond protected site location information. 
-Previously taken images of Native American human remains should not be shown or used in publications, yet they still are consistently, and often in ways that are completely unnecessary to prove the point of the publication. Similar issues exist with sacred objects.       

-Why are we supposed to continue citing the work of known sexual harassers in peer-reviewed publications? ",Disagree,"Again, more information than site information often should be protected.  In addition, with today's push towards open-access and digital archiving, when looking up a site, I can often find ""protected"" site information with a simple google search, which is quite disturbing - often from federal and state agency reports.  ",Disagree,"Again, this needs to be stronger.  There has been a curation crisis for decades - and yet there is still a big push to go excavate a new site to gain an academic degree, and a notable second-tier hierarchy for those who choose to do collections-based research. 

So. Many. repositories are unsustainable, and hold archaeological collections that do not meet modern archival standards of care.  And these same institutions that do not fund collections care often do not support repatriation, or do so grudgingly only because it is federal law.  It is honestly a disgrace to the field and to the profession.  ",Disagree,"Again, this could be worded better.  The title does not quite match the statement.  Where is the focus on preventing sexual harassment, teaching ethics, and foregrounding tribal, descendant and local community involvement?  Where is the discussion of student training, community training, and making local field schools accessible and affordable? ",Strongly Disagree,"Again, this needs to be much stronger.  This has been an ongoing issue in the field for a long time.  ",Disagree,"As an aspiration statement, it needs to be much more strongly worded. I do not think it accurately encompasses all of our current ethical concerns today; there need to be additional principles/headers.  It would likely be easier to start from scratch and rewrite the entire document than trying to edit what is so dated and weak.  ",Disagree,"Nope. Working partnerships with Native communities are not stated (perhaps vaguely hinted at), and sexual harassment is barely addressed. The curation crisis could also be better stated and envisioned. 

Perhaps under each principle, there could be a link to additional resources for that particular topic - websites, podcasts, blogs, articles, etc.  ",Disagree,"There is very little about museums, and almost nothing about CRM or gov't agencies.  ",Yes,"-NAGPRA/repatriation

From when I was 10+ years ago, I was aware of concerns with how archaeologists managed their work in response to pressures from developers (pressure being to not see things, not report them, not require monitors, and similar); how archaeologists respected and interacted with stakeholders and associated communities (appropriate consultation); and ensuring good documentation and curation of the sites we work on and materials we collect (particularly under strained budgets and pressures from developers). I expect these pressures still exist, but I can't speak to them directly.

Publication concerns such as plagiarism and appropriate use/purchase of publications for teaching are perennial, but have also taken new shapes in our more digital world. I wouldn't call them the major issues, but because they are essential to building both careers and trust within the profession, they should be called out for attention more often than they currently are.

Gender-based harassment and discrimination are major issue and ones I know the SAA has been/is struggling with. We need constant vigilance for these, and an ethical culture that creates equality (at minimum) for those who report having been harmed by them.

We are also living in an era of climate change and - as I type - a US that may finally be waking up to its centuries of racial inequality and discrimination. We should ensure that our ethical principles require clear and equal (at minimum) attention to communities and peoples whose voices have been muffled. While ethical principles should not prescribe research topics or products, archaeologists should ensure that our science is clear and accessible with respect to major issues facing society. It may also become an ethical issue to ensure that equitable portions of archaeological effort are divided between basic research and research that is applied to major issues facing society. ",Agree,,Agree,,Agree,,Neutral,"Currently archaeological information is not well-integrated or used in the global response to climate change. While more analysis of the reasons for this are needed, part of the reason (from personal research in the issue) appears to be that archaeologists have ended their analyses at the point of archaeological understanding and NOT ensured that links are available from their research to climate issues facing society. They have left it to others to make the connections, which has resulted in archaeology being left out of most major climate assessments of the past 30 years. While this may feel scientifically safe, it has created a context in which archaeological sites and the information and connections they hold are not valued by the world at large, and by extension both sites and information are at greater risk of destruction by climate impacts and the global climate response lacks human time depth. Archaeologists must have responsibility to engage in major modern social issues.",Agree,,Agree,"Recognition is growing that in situ preservation may not be possible in a growing number of places due to impacts of climate change. While I don't think this should change publication ethics, changes in the dangers to in situ materials due to climate change should be recognized somewhere.",Agree,,Disagree,"There's a piece missing here, which is funding for curation and write up. In the grants of which I have been a part, funding for the final stages of research were considered to be someone else's responsibility, not that of the research funders. This makes compliance with this ethical standard difficult for everyone - from university colleagues who must wedge the writing and curation parts in amongst all their other duties, and from my experience as a graduate student or independent researcher - doing it for free and/or at personal expense. If we recognize these components are essential to ethical archaeological practice, they MUST be properly funded. ",Disagree,"The first sentence of this doesn't fit with the rest of it. While absolutely we all have responsibility to the next generation, we also have responsibilities to each other in the same generation and older generations. It's not just harassment going forward we need to address, its recognizing harassment that has already happened that has not been addressed or is going on now.

Personally I feel that accountability is the most important ethical concern because of the social and political implications for our society and field at large. Anthropology and archaeology are inherently colonial, and I do not think all archaeologists recognize this or necessarily know how to make sure that they are accountable to affected groups (especially indigenous groups) when ideas come into conflict.
That said, I also think that stewardship is a hugely pressing ethical concern. We are often more focused on the in situ archaeological record, including the protection of archaeological sites and the prevention of looting, etc. This is somewhat ironic when many archaeologists don't take the time to fully engage in public education and outreach in an effort to mitigate this problem. As much as in situ preservation is an integral component of stewardship, it is only a portion of the archaeological record and I think overemphasizing this portion of the record is a severe detriment to the stewardship and management of archaeological materials held in collections.

There needs to be a balance in whether and what to excavate, what to actively preserve, and what to avoid that is recognized and attended to in a judicious, scholarly, and ethical manner that considers to long-term needs of multiple stakeholder groups as well as our shared understanding and experience of the human condition. European scholars recognize that just avoiding archaeology and leaving it in place can result in deterioration and loss of archaeological knowledge at a vast scale and is not demonstrated to be inherently good. Materials of cultural and archaeological significance do not constitute an archaeological record if they are not actually recorded. ",Agree,"Yes, but there needs to be a better and more open and transparent process for doing this. Often, consultation is simply sending letters and paying lip service.

As a consulting archaeologist, I sometimes need to consult ethical guidelines to make sure decisions I make fall within the bounds of the agreements I have signed up for when joining these organizations.

Additionally, I was a part of an investigative committee for the RPA and had to consult the ethical guidelines extensively in order to fulfill my role in investigating the individual and circumstances involved in the alleged unethical incident.","The biggest concern I have personally is the increased corporatization and bottomfeeding in CRM archaeology, which makes it difficult to carry out scopes of work that adequately address the potential for significant archaeological resources to exist in the particular APE.

This one would need to be more programmatic in approaching solutions.",Agree,,Agree,"The ethical thinking reflected in the Principles best reflects US academic culture. Other countries have different ethical cultures and other concerns. Additionally, although I think CRM in the US derives from the Academy, different or only partially overlapping ethical concerns arise in it, and the principles though, on the whole, good, do not fully encompass ethics needed for a discipline mixing science and business.",Neutral,The principles are not strongly geared toward CRM archaeology.

I have referred to each of these for multiple purposes;  in the past decade specifically to identify gaps and/or inclusion of indigenous self-identified concerns.  The ability for a dominant and/or privileged population to define the roles, responsibilities, objects, and identity or 'others' is repeatedly demonstrated to erode and undermine sovereignty of Nations.","the continued use of distancing language the creates positionality of direct and/or indirect power structures (dominate/suppressed).  Past generations of professional, particularly in anthropology and archaeology, by the nature of the academic process create 'specialists' and 'experts on the subject of Other people (their lives, belongings, thoughts, etc.).  The development of Codes of Ethics by- and for- these same experts reaffirms positionality.  Repeatedly the result is an academic Expert makes a declarative statement ""X is true!"" and the Tribe or decedents of the 'subject people' says, ""No, that is not true.  This is true!"".  Immediately there is a conflict.  Additionally, 'experts' will chose to research a subject that is taboo to a community and perceived to be inappropriate to be discussed by the uninitiated.  Those communities have no control over the dispersal of that information and are left vulnerable and even sensationalized.  

Today's Tribes and Indigenous nations have withstood plagues, systematic genocide, reservations, and educational systems, all designed to remove them from existence.  there for what is held in community (knowledge, language, understanding, belongings, etc.) is highly intimate and protected.  When specialists flex their expertise it is a dominating act.  When Codes of Ethics are developed one-on-one with the nations with whom you work there will begin to be a balanced understanding of HOW to proceed.  for example, the current code (Intellectual Property) does not recognize that information may originate with a Tribe who may not be comfortable with it being shared outside of community.
