If so, please specify which organization's and how you have used them.",Please feel free to elaborate on your answer here:,What do you see as being the primary ethical concerns in the field today?,"Principle 1: Stewardship

The archaeological record, that is, in situ archaeological material and sites, archaeological collections, records and reports, is irreplaceable. It is the responsibility of all archaeologists to work for the long-term conservation and protection of the archaeological record by practicing and promoting stewardship of the archaeological record. Stewards are both caretakers of and advocates for the archaeological record for the benefit of all people; as they investigate and interpret the record, they should use the specialized knowledge they gain to promote public understanding and support for its long-term preservation. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:,"Principle 2: Accountability

Responsible archaeological research, including all levels of professional activity, requires an acknowledgment of public accountability and a commitment to make every reasonable effort, in good faith, to consult actively with affected group(s), with the goal of establishing a working relationship that can be beneficial to all parties involved. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:,"Principle 3: Commercialization

The Society for American Archaeology has long recognized that the buying and selling of objects out of archaeological context is contributing to the destruction of the archaeological record on the American continents and around the world. The commercialization of archaeological objects - their use as commodities to be exploited for personal enjoyment or profit - results in the destruction of archaeological sites and of contextual information that is essential to understanding the archaeological record. Archaeologists should therefore carefully weigh the benefits to scholarship of a project against the costs of potentially enhancing the commercial value of archaeological objects. Whenever possible they should discourage, and should themselves avoid, activities that enhance the commercial value of archaeological objects, especially objects that are not curated in public institutions, or readily available for scientific study, public interpretation, and display.
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:,"Principle 4: Public Education and Outreach

Archaeologists should reach out to, and participate in cooperative efforts with others interested in the archaeological record with the aim of improving the preservation, protection, and interpretation of the record. In particular, archaeologists should undertake to: 1) enlist public support for the stewardship of the archaeological record; 2) explain and promote the use of archaeological methods and techniques in understanding human behavior and culture; and 3) communicate archaeological interpretations of the past. Many publics exist for archaeology including students and teachers; Native Americans and other ethnic, religious, and cultural groups who find in the archaeological record important aspects of their cultural heritage; lawmakers and government officials; reporters, journalists, and others involved in the media; and the general public. Archaeologists who are unable to undertake public education and outreach directly should encourage and support the efforts of others in these activities. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:,"Principle 5: Intellectual Property

Intellectual property, as contained in the knowledge and documents created through the study of archaeological resources, is part of the archaeological record. As such it should be treated in accord with the principles of stewardship rather than as a matter of personal possession. If there is a compelling reason, and no legal restrictions or strong countervailing interests, a researcher may have primary access to original materials and documents for a limited and reasonable time, after which these materials and documents must be made available to others. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:,"Principle 6: Public Reporting and Publication

Within a reasonable time, the knowledge archaeologists gain from investigation of the archaeological record must be presented in accessible form (through publication or other means) to as wide a range of interested publics as possible. The documents and materials on which publication and other forms of public reporting are based should be deposited in a suitable place for permanent safekeeping. An interest in preserving and protecting in situ archaeological sites must be taken in to account when publishing and distributing information about their nature and location. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:,"Principle 7: Records and Preservation

Archaeologists should work actively for the preservation of, and long term access to, archaeological collections, records, and reports. To this end, they should encourage colleagues, students, and others to make responsible use of collections, records, and reports in their research as one means of preserving the in situ archaeological record, and of increasing the care and attention given to that portion of the archaeological record which has been removed and incorporated into archaeological collections, records, and reports. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:,"Principle 8: Training and Resources

Given the destructive nature of most archaeological investigations, archaeologists must ensure that they have adequate training, experience, facilities, and other support necessary to conduct any program of research they initiate in a manner consistent with the foregoing principles and contemporary standards of professional practice. 
 

I feel that this principle and its description adequately applies to archaeological practice and its ethical challenges today.",Please elaborate here:,"Principle 9: Safe Educational and Workplace Environments

Archaeologists in all work, educational, and other professional settings, including fieldwork and conferences, are responsible for training the next generation of archaeologists. Part of these responsibilities involves fostering a supportive and safe environment for students and trainees. This includes knowing the laws and policies of their home nation and institutional workplace that pertain to harassment and assault based upon sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability, national origin, religion, or marital status. SAA members will abide by these laws and ensure that the work and educational settings in which they have responsible roles as supervisors are conducted so as to avoid violations of these laws and act to maintain safe and respectful work and learning environments.

The Textile Society of America mission statement and Diversity Statement (I was involved in formulating the latter)","I see gender-based and sexual harassment as vital concerns, within the broader context of often abusive power relationships in academia, the workplace and the insular experience of fieldwork.

As job opportunities have become more scarce and also of lower quality (impermanent, part-time, low-paid, highly demanding), issues caused by systematic abuse of power by supervisors have deepened, and willingness to defend oneself or others has been eroded.

While I perceive the involvement of archaeologists in owning or even trafficking antiquities to have greatly lessened, I perceive that traffickers and collectors are becoming bolder recently and are challenging the authority of archaeologists, within a broader framework of fomenting disrespect for science and professional standards. We need to strategize about dealing with this.

Legal protections for heritage sites are being challenged, eroded and undone, and SAA has responded appropriately to work against these attacks. This situation requires further education and skill-building, both within and beyond our discipline.",Agree,"I would only add that the principles of stewardship should be integral to our teaching and training of those who will carry on our work, and imparted to others who maintain an interest in archaeological discoveries.",Neutral,"I think this statement should be modified to recognize the agency of others.

The principle is correct, but different types of archaeological analysis require different time frames. Those who study site distribution and architecture reap the first wave of results from survey or excavation, now further facilitated by improved remote sensing and documentation methods. They publish quickly and may seem highly ethical according to this measure, while the time-consuming processes of analyzing different types of excavated materials are left to ""slower"" meticulous colleagues who publish later, and are therefore less likely to be the PI, tenured, funded etc. Too often, the Director moves on to another high profile project, a situation that generates problems in conserving both the data and physical collections, and continues to be rewarded for rapid publication.",Agree,"As we make responsible use of collections, records and reports we should also generate reports on our analytic processes, to be incorporated into the archives we have used. ",Agree,"Archaeologists should seek continuing education in new methods and research strategies, and provide opportunities for continuing education in methods we may develop or master. As we may become more specialized in our research methods, we are likewise responsible for developing research collaborations with others whose expertise complements our own, and should cross-train with them to the extent necessary for strong working relationships and joint publications.",Agree,Compliance with the law is not sufficient for fostering a supportive and safe environment.

The erosion of long-term academic employment (not just tenure, but continuity) deeply affects both undergraduate and graduate education, as well as the ability to direct continuing research. I consider that the SAA needs to develop a position on this issue.

There is no strategic planning to provide training in all aspects of archaeological analysis essential to work with the collections we generate. Instead, jobs and courses emerge in response to market trends in education (eg. bioarchaeologists who can teach premed students, GIS specialists who can teach planners), while important branches of our field lack anyone employed to teach them.

We take a strong ethical position about the commercialization of objects but say nothing about commercialization of the data, knowledge and intellectual outcomes of our work. 

We recognize there are lots of negative externalities to the commercial exploitation of physical remains. We need to similarly assess the negative externalities of commercializing archaeological intellectual property. The ethical problems of draconian copyright laws and the intrusive surveillance of commercial digital publishing platforms (not to mention social media platforms) get very little attention and discussion in the SAA.

These are big problems. If we are serious about making archaeology more inclusive and democratic, then we need to consider the ethics of how we communicate archaeology. 
",Agree,"We should be more clear about how this needs to be multi-directional. Currently it seems all about communicating the value of archaeology outward, but we need multi-directional engagement to help shape archaeological priorities.",Agree,"Again, this is woefully inadequate and incomplete.

The ethical problems of draconian copyright laws and the intrusive surveillance of commercial digital publishing platforms (not to mention social media platforms) get very little attention and discussion in the SAA.

Commercial archaeology largely generates commercial intellectual property, and academic archaeology generates books and papers that are mainly owned by commercial publishers. Access to all of these is restrictive and involves intensive surveillance (representing a threat to privacy and academic freedom). Withholding evidence for ""limited and reasonable time"" gets abused if there are so few positive incentives to motivate comprehensive data sharing.

The SAA needs do more than pay lip-service to the intellectual property issue. Archaeologists still have too many incentives to withhold and cherry-pick data. Perverse incentives to withhold evidence lead to many of the same negative externalities that make the antiquities trade so harmful. Bad ""publish or perish"" incentives lead to the loss of primary evidence and destruction of context because too many archaeologists lack the motivation to adequately share and archive their primary data.
 ",Agree,"Again, this is woefully inadequate and incomplete.

See my prior comment. Data publishing and archiving needs to be mandated as an integral aspect of good professional conduct. Currently, our profession has too many financial and recognition rewards for behaviors that neglect data, thereby destroying key contextual information.

I think it is important for archaeologists to recognize that the public will support what they do only if they feel like it benefits them, and that it enhances their appreciation of the past.

These were reviewed to compare with SAA and examine how each could be used to work through particular ethical scenarios. I teach a class in Ethics & Cultural Property.","Incorporating the views of outside groups into how archaeologists use cultural property and its interpretation. It seems to me this a fundamental problem, because outside folks are not necessarily focused on our goals. Thus, obligations are one-sided and we cannot expect others to act similarly. That's a structural problem. 

The conflict goes to the heart of the primary goals of archaeology, which I believe is to get to an objective truth, although we will likely never get there. Nonetheless, the goal is important to me, and if I was just story-telling, I wouldn't do it. This runs smack dab against the idea of accommodating other interpretations to incorporate other versions of the ""truth."" This goes beyond trivial examples like accommodating a biblical literalist's truth about the age of the earth. Tribes, religions, collectors, nations, past peoples and on and on - they all are affected by what we do.

It's a very complex problem, and it stems in part from an anthropological view of culture as something that is recreated constantly, incorporating and discarding parts in the process. If a culture's past is recreated in the present, then that becomes it's ""truth."" If that's its present view, and we are required to incorporate it into our discipline, then we will, on occasion, have to discard our primary goal.

Having said all that, I do believe we must ""seriously consider"" other viewpoints, however that is defined. It is both an ethic and simple politeness. But if truth is the goal, then other viewpoints will always be judged, and sometimes judged as having no value. Probably, most of the time it will not cause much conflict. The problem is when the interpretation of the ethic is that the conflict requires an archaeologist to discard the primary truth goal. 

Sorry for the preachy tone.

",Strongly Agree,"This is fundamentally problematic. It is a classic fox-in-the-hen-house conflict. Stewardship is simply a trust relationship, which requires the trustee (archaeologists) to act in the best interests of the master or beneficiary of the res (the archaeological record). The record doesn't want anything. We simply assume our masters/beneficiaries want what we want. For anyone who has asked around, this is simply not likely. 

it would be better to state what our goal is in the first Principle - truth, group advocacy, supporting people we affect - pick one. Truth using Western standards of evidence is the primary value implied in the Principle as written. Best to be clear whatever is chosen.",Neutral,"This is probably about as good as we can get. If folks are honest about it, it will work in most cases. The crux of the problem is ""affected group"", although ""consult"" is also open to widely different interpretations. 

 I think about a situation in which a group wants to consult on my work, which is on material and people who lived over 10,000 years ago in the Southeast. If I interpret ""affected group"" to encompass some reasonable standard of cultural connection, I'd be justified in concluding no one living today is affected. If I interpret the term to include people who say they are affected, then that could include tribes, Barry Fell enthusiasts, archaeologists, and Biblical literalists.  ",Neutral,"This needs to be tweaked. I agree that commercialization is a problem. But everything we publish, talk about in public presentations, etc. arguably enhances commercial value. Even if I told someone an artifact was ""rare"", its value could be increased. Maybe a partial list of things that are OK, even through they may enhance value.",Agree,,Agree,"I agree with this, but people don't often follow it.

Is there space for consensual relationships, or are these always corrupt because the higher ranked person will tend to favor his or her lover over others of similar rank.

",Disagree,"The ""archaeological record"" is itself a problematic concept, as it is essentially a metaphor derived from natural resource management fields.

It is the obligation of the archaeological community to create broadly accessible long-term, repositories that have the capacity to authentic users and user credentials for use and access. It is the responsibility of archaeologists to contribute to these repositories in a timely fashion. It is also the responsibility of of hiring and funding institutions to recognize that the contribution of structured archaeological data is at least as important as published interpretations and reward such contributions with financial incentives.

The great majority were excavated many years ago. Similarly Mississippian human head effigies. I would assume that similar situations apply in Latin and South America. Probably 80+ percent of the objects are in private hands. It is probably not too far off the mark to say that many pre-columbian ""high art"" objects are not in public settings. These objects often played significant roles in the pre-columbian communities and their careful study and documentation provides a significant insight. In many cases their exposure to modern descendant communities can provide valuable insights to the communities past. Yet, to study these clearly increases their commercial value. I have no easy solution to this corundum. I would suggest rewriting the last sentence to say something like

 Whenever possible they should carefully assess the information, scientific and descendant community benefits  that any analysis would generate and only in those cases where such benefits clearly are significant should proceed, otherwise they should discourage, and should themselves avoid, activities that enhance the commercial value of archaeological objects, especially objects that are not curated in public institutions, or readily available for scientific study, public interpretation, and display.

There is a significant literature on this. 

Archaeologists have responsibilities, yes, but are not the appropriate stewards in many situations, nor should they be. ""All people"" is a moral and philosophical stance with respect to cultural heritage and material culture. In some situations, the appropriate response for a community is to allow degradation (through use or otherwise). Also, sometimes, things should not be seen or accessed by all people.

Also, engaging the reality of the political economy of archaeology in this statement would assist archaeologists to see how the structures in which our professional lives are enmeshed, formed, and limited/enabled, has a huge, huge effect on how we interpret what should or can be preserved. In other words, most archaeologists are failing massively in terms of any kind of complete or capable or competent protection of the archaeological record, depending on how stewardship, protection, and preservation are defined (whether compliance, CRM, academic in origin). 

This aspirational principle, in its current form, is almost not helpful because of the discontinuity with what most of us are trained and paid to do most often (destroy and make limited record of contexts; with limited curation; with severely limited resource base for preservation, conservation, interpretation, access, and interoperability).  If we really took seriously this call,  stewardship would refocus every single person on existing collections and on mitigating through publication collections that result from the ongoing destruction that society deems unavoidable due to needs for nicer houses or less traffic or more electricity, etc.   ",Neutral,"Mentioning work and consultation well in advance of research, mitigation, etc. would be a positive addition here.",Agree,,Agree,,Disagree,"Often, IP that is recorded in the record belongs to OTHER people.

Collections stewardship is another, and the lack of support for collections and collections-based research in general, because collections-based work supports a conservation ethic but is not necessarily seen as ""real"" archaeology or new research. In CRM there are a lot of issues with keeping the budget down leading to quick, shoddy work with lack of follow-through maintaining the results long-term (digital data management, sufficient analysis and report writing time, curation, etc.). The tendency is to dig, dig, dig, when it should be to think, plan, synthesize, and only dig when you have to. 

I believe open access to data is another ethical obligation we have to the public who funds most archaeology. We need to rethink policies about site location confidentiality, instead focusing on community engagement in protection rather than secrecy within the ivory tower.

I truly believe that we shoot ourselves in the foot trying to be so secretive about sites in the interest of protection. The locations of historic sites are often part of the public record, and collectors know better where most precontact sites are than archaeologists do so we gain nothing by restricting public access to our reports. Community engagement is a better strategy in an age when people (rightfully) demand access to the data their tax dollars paid for. Empowering the community by letting them know of the rich resources in their area so they want to help protect them is a benefit, and I think that benefit outweighs the rare instances where people will abuse the knowledge.",Disagree,"And yet, so many people don't respect this kind of work. Academic programs often require fieldwork in order for research to be considered ""new."" This discourages synthesis and harms our ability to live by the conservation ethic. The main thing I think is missing here is a statement about artifact conservation; a step that is often neglected, ignored, or done on a DIY basis as if professional conservators are no better at doing conservation than archaeologists are. That's like saying hobby metal detectorists are just as good at doing archaeology as archaeologists are. It's hard to convince archaeologists to spend money, but it's unconscionable to pretend that the same rules of professionalism and training that apply to being allowed to be called a professional archaeologist somehow don't apply to scientific field of conservation.

Setting this challenge aside (as it is being addressed by SAA in other venues), the primary ethical concern that I encounter on regular basis in my work as a public (CRM/professional) archaeologist is the lack of professional standards. There are two issues of professionalism in the field that concern me. 

The first is the quality of training at the undergraduate and MA levels. I would not describe the current status of archaeological education as ""adequate"" under Principle 8. BAs do not prepare students to work in the field. In my experience, MA standards are also often so low that recent graduates are unable to accomplish basic necessary work (e.g. fully recording their excavations, hand-mapping, setting up excavation units, calculating distances in relationship to data, etc.). As a result, CRM professionals are often not empowered to challenge unethical behavior because their training has not equipped them to evaluate the boundary between good and bad practice. This cultivates the attitude that ""that's the way things are done"" in the field, another factor encouraging a culture of silence that has numerous other negative effects (now well-documented). Add onto this the precarity of employment among entry- and early-professional-level archaeologists, and it is impossible to expect good practice to result.

The second issue of professionalism is the lack of publication in peer-reviewed venues. I do not believe that Principle 6 adequately addresses the most important underlying imperative for peer-review: oversight of practice by qualified outsiders. If data recovery projects are undertaken to preserve archaeological data as a mitigation measure, it is difficult to justify them if the data they produce are rarely (or never) evaluated in the literature. When CRM projects are reviewed by other CRM professionals only, and the field lacks a single, necessary venue for dissemination of this type of archaeological data (in the form of appropriate peer-reviewed journals accessible to all professional archaeologists), then unqualified or unscrupulous archaeologists can continue to practice. Beyond that, they can do so with a competitive advantage because of their ingorance of good practice and/or their willingness to ignore their duties. This implicates the entire field's responsibility to the archaeological record (under Principle No. 1) and to the public (under Principle No. 2).

-

Another ethical concern that I regularly encounter is the unrealistic assumptions about what a career in the field looks like in 2020. University-based research and teaching faculty at 2- and 4-year institutions train students, but they usually do not prepare them to work as archaeologists. A single field school is not sufficient preparation for field practice, and does not satisfy Principle No. 8. As a result, BAs are expected to learn on the fly in CRM. The very tight schedules and the very low budgets do not leave room for learning on the job. The result is a workforce of seasonal/hourly BAs, undertrained and overqualified (on paper). 

The underlying ethical concern, however, is how the field treats those individuals. A new graduate can reasonably be expected to have five figures of student debt (or more, if they have attended some amount graduate school [whether they completed their course of study or not]). They are then expected to spend multiple years gaining CRM experience as hourly or project-specific employees, subject to schedules outside of their control and often without access to support in the form of healthcare or other employment benefits. This set of affairs is excellent - for the owners of CRM companies who can exploit their employees without having any responsiblity to them, for the academic archaeologists who rely on unpaid labor to generate data for publications, and for the industries that seek out the least-qualified consultants they can to conduct ""oversight"" of their projects. 

The field must dedicate more care to training new archaeologists at every level and to ensuring that the next generation has the opportunity to succeed. The over-production of BA and MA students and the lack of opportunties for the overwhelming majority of them is shameful. The unrealistic expectations of students, who do not know any better, and academic archaeologists, who do know better, must change. Given my experiences, I ask myself why the field should expect to attract and retain talented young students who will perform their professional duties ethically. And this is not only a question of professional ethics or of ensuring the robustness of archaeology in the future. It is even more fundamentally a question of decency and morality.",Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Disagree,"I believe that stronger langauge is necessary to improve Principle 8.

archaeology specifically: descendant communities (few archaeologists even now consider this), repatriating collections to home institutions (even when that means chasing down funds to help them build collections facilities), destruction of archaeological heritage & illicit antiquities trafficking. Here I am not talking about writing articles that promote one's own professional career. I'm talking about on-the-ground work with law enforcement and descendant communities and non-profits that does not yield a line in one's resume.

* those are all our responsibilities as professional archaeologists but few people I know think about them and fewer still volunteer time to address these issues: which puts an awful lot of responsibility on a very small number of us
",Strongly Agree,"Right - but a lot of archaeologists will not invest time in actually *doing* the work because it doesn't net them professional credit.  In the US, anyway, we seem to leave most stewardship to federal agencies and a few token ""public archaeologists"" rather than embedding stewardship into our projects (and asking for funding for stewardship in our grant proposals)",Strongly Agree,"Right - but this is not just a matter of submitting reports on time (a practice which some of my colleagues seem also not to do). Active consultation requires developing long-term relationships that sometimes do not produce permissions for years. We would let someone take a backhoe to our patios without a whole lot of discussion, and yet most archaeologists seem to feel like -- if they are on public land and have official permission-- it doesn't much matter what descendant communities think. Or they focus on one sector of descendant communities who will work with them, and do not invest effort in working with the dissenters.

I'm not surprised, now, that so many descendant communities lump archaeologists with developers, because too many use their privilege to do whatever they please.  I work in Southeast Asia, and AFTER I get my official permissions I consult with local stakeholders: even when the official permitters think this is extraneous.  Occasionally I am told that we aren't welcome; most of the time we can work where we request; and everyone feels better about it. But we excavate smaller areas, and invest more time in consultation, than almost any archaeologist I know. So the field needs to support and reward people for doing the right thing.",Strongly Agree,"Right again! But I only know a small handful of archaeologists who have ever, for example, worked with US Border and Customs control or the FBI to actually STOP trafficking.  There are a few exemplary non-profits now who also do great work  (The Antiquities Coalition, Blue Shield International; then for Cambodia we have Heritage Watch, and I hope other countries have similar small but important NGO's): but these aren't generally run by archaeologists.

We don't get credit for this either.",Strongly Agree,"Yup indeed. But the term ""public archaeology"" still has a slightly negative feel. People who are ""public archaeologists"" are not ""research archaeologists"" and the fact that I have nurtured a local museum for the last 20 years in Cambodia (grant-seeking, exhibits development, etc.) has not netted me ANY credit ANYWHERE.

I'm not complaining: I am actually quite satisfied with my career. But the fact that I've gotten no credit explains why so few of my junior colleagues do not consider doing such work.

An ethical professional archaeology expects all practitioners to do this work as part of their job, and rewards them for it. ",Strongly Agree,"Yes indeed. Very few archaeologists I know include their in-country colleagues as co-authors. So strange. We do this now in Cambodia and the fact that I have done it since 1999 is starting to pressure others to do the same. Ditto with my 2000-2006 policy when editing a regional journal: I asked western authors to include their in-country colleagues as authors, and that little act has begun to change Asian archaeology (I exclude China here, because they have their own tradition).

Also: too many researchers will not share data, or collections, even though they never get around to publishing them. Sometimes the collections disintegrate or lose provenience during this time that nothing is done with them. That's just wrong. ",Strongly Agree,"Many archaeologists I know love to do fieldwork. So do I. But these archaeologists hate to stop to analyze and write up what they've done. They seem to think that the very act of going into the field makes them productive, and that kind of performative mindset hurts the profession.

I was delighed, some years back, when the indubitable Egyptian archaeologist Zawi Hawass halted ALL FIELDWORK BY FOREIGN TEAMS IN EGYPT. All of it. He said that people had to first cough up more reports and publications, and then he'd let them back in the country. 

I can imagine that working with Zawi Hawass could be quite a challenge, but I applaud his decision. We need more of that.",Strongly Agree,"What can I say? Our little unexceptional U Hawaii archaeology program has spent the better part of the last decade documenting and repatriating old collections to Pacific and Asian localities from whence they came, because I pushed for it. And lots of colleagues hated me for pushing: but I was following Principle 7 of the SAA Ethics code, and they couldn't prevail.

I will add that host countries, while grappling with their own collections management issues, have largely welcomed the repatriations. And the fact that we've repatriated collections puts pressure on archaeological colleagues with collections at their home institutions to repatriate: a good thing.

But it would be nice if this were standard professional practice, rather than responses to a crabby sanctimonious archaeological colleague like me. :-)  ",Strongly Agree,"It's the wild west in our profession.  Until I intervened, our department actually sponsored an ""archaeological field school"" run by a biologist on Kauai (with nominal oversight by an archaeologist in my department who got salary but didn't go there) for students that offered them double the credits (12 credits) for five weeks of experience.  It took me several months, many phone calls and emails, and consultation with various agencies to figure out how this had happened in my own department (it was my job, as Archaeology convenor, to decide which field schools to offer). Wow.

To keep this in perspective, I once brought a UH grad student into the field in Cambodia with me who had completed a U Arizona field school and didn't know how to use a transit. U Arizona is MY alma mater! I was fortunate that one of my Cambodian students knew how to map and could train the American student. But still.

 I would love to see RPA or SAA certification required for all credit-bearing field schools.",Strongly Agree,"The sexual harassment situation is a lot better now than when I was a student (and we warned each other when groper archaeologists were in the vicinity), but it still happens. And we don't effective ways of dealing with it. As one example, a female graduate student in our program accompanied a colleague to China for fieldwork. One night there, they both drank too much and he propositioned her (he *did* ask; he didn't force) and she said no. It made her so uncomfortable that she talked with a few of us about it, but -- short of her lodging an official complaint against him -- we were, I was told, unable to help her. She dropped out of the program. This shouldn't happen.


Neither should both male and female professional archaeologists violate these ethics, if having sex with undergraduate and graduate students is included as a no-no.  I know about cases from the students who slept with them: and sadly this includes two female professors and their undergraduate male students.  This shouldn't happen, and there should be penalties.

",Strongly Disagree,"As we discussed so many years ago when I was a Member At Large on the SAA Board in the 2000s. The Ethics code is strongest on the archaeological record; for that I am grateful to Alison Wylie and Mark Lynott. But the code remains terribly weak on the people side (descendant communities, students, etc.).  Joe Watkins may remember me as appearing (to most of my fellow board members) as a strident leftist or something in pointing these issues out, but my points have emerged through a series of egregious experiences since then.  I was told repeatedly that ""the SAA is a service organization, and has no legal teeth"": but we really could have done a better job in outlining ethical expectations then.

How I wish that the SAA had not been so risk-aversive. We could have avoided the kind of blowback (particularly after last year's meeting) that drives younger members away. I can't tell you how frustrating it has been to try to remind my junior colleagues that the SAA is US, and that starting a new organization does not fundamentally change the system. So frustrating. Anyway, it's great that you folks are returning to these issues now.

",Neutral,"It could definitely take stronger stands.  I love the fact that some countries will only give permits to archaeologists if they include funding and a plan for either site conservation or a local museum or training. Why not require that of all archaeologists working everywhere, and then work with major funding agencies so they include these activities under what they will fund?  It could work.",Disagree,"But I want to support you folks because it's a good start, and so much better than the opaque AAA Code of Ethics. At least I can use the SAA Code of Ethics for teaching, and then elaborate. Keep up the good work: and don't be afraid to push more aggressively. Our timidity in the past came back to bite us.",Yes,"I've outlined them in my previous comments. 

We need to all remember -- even people working in Illinois' American Bottom, or in the middle of New York state -- that we are guests in someone else's heritage world.  Most archaeologists remain remarkably arrogant: a relic of the white male privilege in which our field emerged, sadly.",1,2,3,5,4,Separate Principles of Ethics and Standards of Practice,"I've outlined what we need. But please don't just write a blog. That's what the AAA has, and it has no teeth. We need a real document that we can share with our host countries, that we can use to teach our students, and that we can dangle around our ""colleagues"" who misbehave unless reminded to be good.

Let me be clear here: I have met scores of really good, ethical archaeologists who do the right thing and work hard. They don't need this Ethics Code, because they have always lived it. But there are a large number of self-serving archaeologists who evidently need to be shown what ethical behavior looks like, and they need this. We also need a solid document to share with our administrators when we seek $$ to pay shipping costs for repatriation; we need the document to share with students who join our field programs; and we need the document when problems arise that we need to mediate.

I know we are just a service organization, but I have now worked on boards or committees with every major archaeological organization in the world that affects Southeast Asia, and SAA should set the standard. I believe we can do this, and that -- with our support behind you folks -- you will.

Personally I would not want to buy any such deaccessioned object but I can't argue strongly against it. 

I think this says we should weigh the value of the work against the potential to increase looting. In Latin and South America especially it is too late. Any continuing work will increase the value of at least some objects. Shall we stop all archaeology in these places.

SEAC","1 ) ACADEMIA
Students who take on graduate studies are not guaranteed professional relationships with mentors and colleagues. 

Academic professors are not vetted for there ability to foster professional mentorships and/or to provide a certain standard of academic guidance and caregiving to the students they have accepted.

Professors/academic staff seemingly have free reign to weed out students who are not ""immediately participatory in"" and/or ""fully adept at"" any necessary departmental politics. Students who are prone to think critically, and independently or students who seek the full boundaries and characteristics of collegial atmosphere may be steered out of academic programs. 
Archaeology/anthropology professional relations are not taught or reviewed in undergraduate studies.

Archaeology/Anthropology graduate studies can be an extreme investment financially, personally and professionally and student debt is at and all time high. These circumstances can disproportionately affect nontraditional students, or those students that are the first in their family to seek a higher education - PhD. or M.A.

2 ) ON CALL ARCHAEOLOGY
I am unfamiliar with the circumstance in most states but in one of the most expensive states to reside ""On Call"" or gig archaeology employment is in many cases the only opportunity for employment in the discipline. Having participated in ""On call"" archaeology for 5 years after gaining my M.A. degree and having worked full time in Archaeology/CRM for 3 years post B.A. and before the M.A., I believe I can offer important insight.
Companies that provide on-call archaeology opportunities take zero responsibility in the unfortunate circumstances and short and long term health and lifestyle effects of this type employment. They offer no increased wages/compensation for this ""on the fly"" and often last minute request for field staff and immediate project/client responsive deployments. Many times field deployments are into extremely harsh and totally unfamiliar work environments for unknown amounts of time and they put stress on personal health and personal/family relationships. Many deployments put personal safety in a whole different category as a result of unfamiliar work and living arrangements. From my observations other on call archaeologists (M.A./B.A) who may be desperate for steady work may chose unsafe work relations mistakenly placed in the category of ""a competitive work environment"" in order to prevail as the higher performing employee.  

Many of the companies providing these opportunities seemingly adopt a ""good doer"" or ""employment proving hero"" type of attitude by saving you from periods of unemployment. In reality they are capitalizing as much as possible as a result of this gig economy and they are perhaps normalizing one of the most unfortunate aspects of this career. In reality many of the supervisors of on call employment have little to know knowledge of the circumstances of this type of employment, as it's possible many have never operated as on call archaeologists. In addition the on call field archaeologist can provide higher quality and better responsive field archaeology then the supervisors can guide or recommend. Or they are providing a work talent that is difficult to find but completely underappreciated and under-compensated for. Supervisors may be much more recent company hires as a result of their client relations or computer/gis skills. Full time employment is thereby gained as result of having clients that you bring in as a new hire and may have nothing to do with quality work or dedicated on call response with a particular company.

 ""On call"" opportunities typically provide no guaranteed compensation for all the pre-deployment correspondence/scheduling, the many work supplies (dig kit/recordation material), the storage for all these supplies including personal PPE during gaps between work, the yearly resume updating, or the necessary timecard and expense processing. Because many clients or companies require receipts for food expense reimbursement there can be zero privacy in personal food purchase and consumption.
On call archaeologists can make no long term planning and or important financial decisions about their lifestyle as a result of unpredictable work opportunity.

These circumstances mandate a closer look at the trajectory of employment in the field of cultural resource management, and whether CRM can be a self respecting and mentally healthy career opportunity and feasible career choice. If this status quo continues more transparency is needed about the characteristics of the lifestyle before students pursue academic studies gearing them in to this direction. Also, companies should be confronted about their part in the exploitative circumstance.

I have recently started a new small business and one of my top priorities is to address this exploitative circumstance. I hope to offer public and community archaeology education outreach and or indigenous archaeology as additions to CRM projects throughout the year and thereby minimize on call employment or seasonal work. If there are grants or other funding opportunities for these diverse employment opportunities and engagements and SAA can help facilitate this please highlight this information in future SAA updates and opportunities.

In general, most archaeologists will support it in theory. It is reasonable and, certainly, commendable to allow access to others after a reasonable time has passed.

Many, many roadblocks may occur to keep a project from reaching this ideal. There is usually not enough money to thoroughly analyze and report on a project, there are not always sufficient outlets where it may be published, and depositing of both data and artifact collections are among the most contentious issues facing our field. As a Corps of Engineers report many years ago reported for California alone, 40% of artifact collections from CRM projects were held by private contractors because there was no place else for them to go, either due to lack of money and/or institution where they could be curated.  ",Agree,"I believe that this is an essential principle to be encouraged and I think that archaeologists are getting better at it, though many academic institutions need to do better. Doing original fieldwork for a dissertation should not always be the only way to get a doctoral degree. In the bigger picture, it is essential that this kind of thing happen more and more rapidly to sustain the Federal Government's belief that what archaeologists do on, particularly CRM project, are in the public's best interest. There have been investigations into the use and value of collections and the amount of public money spent to curate and store them. If archaeologists do not make better use of these collections to provide the public with interesting and useful understanding of our past, we may soon find the public money for our work disappear.

In the Rocky Mountain West, there is a current trend of overemphasizing Native American ""consultation"".  Too frequently a ""tribal position"" is taken as gospel, i.e. ""all sites are sacred and you archaeologists (read blue eyes) shouldn't tough them.  Let them be destroyed"".  This violates Section 106 consultation, to the delight of  pro industry land managers and developers. The minority of consulting archaeologists who do bad work, i.e. blow off sites, has diminished but is still a problem.  TPOs come and go, but frequently engage in unethical behavior, due to financial considerations or their lack of adequate training and education. NAGPRA is a totally abused system, NPS, as well as select federal agencies, has sold the farm on NAGPRA,  repatriating back to whomever just to clear the shelves of archaeological materials, not true NAGPRA articles.

DNA research should be a required element  of human remains study when considering repatriating human remains many hundreds, certainly thousands of years old.  How else are we to untangle issues surrounding the population of the Americas?  Trashing the very resource, the tools of legitimate scientific inquiry by repatriating lacking adequate and complete scientific study (and analysis) to me is a SIGNAL violation of archaeological ethics. 3-D imagery of soon to be repatriated material should be a requirement of NAGPRA materials.

A mutually beneficial working relationship is a great aspiration as well, but we must account for those moments when communities do not want research to continue (or to start) and those wishes should be honored.

Also, what about the generation of knowledge that would be helpful to publics?

But there are several areas where the current principles do not go far enough. Principle Number 9, for instance, says that archaeologists are responsible to know the laws and policies of their home nations and institutional workplaces, and to abide by them. But this implies a narrow legalistic approach that does not respond adequately to the range of behaviors that can create hostile or just unpleasant work environments for many (especially junior) archaeologists.  Avoiding any sort of harassment, bullying, or discrimination against coworkers, subordinates, or colleagues should be a principle of archaeological ethics, regardless of any particular nation's or institution's policies. This principle is especially important in archaeology, where field research often creates social situations where it can seem that normal rules of social interaction do not apply (though problems can arise in any academic or work setting, not just in the field). Supervisors and organizations have a responsibility to not just avoid harassing or bullying subordinates, but have an ethical responsibility to deliberately create an environment where such behavior is not tolerated and all participants can participate safely. 

The non-harassment, non-bullying ethical principle should also extend to peer reviews. Critical reviews are sometimes warranted, but using the cover of anonymity to attack and insult authors or unfairly characterize their work (or to unreasonably promote the reviewer's work) is both common and deeply unethical. It should be explicitly covered in the SAA Principles, and SAA should ensure that reviewers for the society's journals do not engage in such abuse.

I also would argue that depite the current Principles 6 and 7 (concerning reporting and data sharing), there are ethical concerns surrounding data availability and replicability of analyses. SAA should push for open science policies for archaeological data, to the greatest extent possible. There are, of course, issues with site location data, but whenever articles are published, data (and code related to analysis) should be made available. SAA could and should do much more to promote this kind of data sharing (by requiring a data sharing statement with every article published in the society's journals, for instance).

",Agree,"I do have some questions about how this applies to archaeologists working in cultural resource management, who often are forced to decide what can and cannot be preserved, and who are frequently forced into situations where limited time or money force uncomfortable decisions.

I understand it is hard to publish in a timely fashion (I am certainly an offender, as I think most of us are), but at some point a scholar should cede partial or total control of a project/assemblage, and not hoard data.

Additionally, I would add that the sale of archaeological material can be done in an ethical manner.  An example is unprovenienced objects.  Why not sell an arrowhead to a interested person for a couple dollars, or a object of greater value, but not within the mandate of the institution's mission statement on Ebay?

This individual has continued to treat the excavation records as personal property even after more than 50 years.  Not only has he been unable to complete a report, he has refused yo make the information available to other scholars as well as the federally recognized tribe (Onondaga Iroquois).

Another area is regarding the submission of data and reports from CRM firms whose contracted fieldwork may have been ended due to a lack of funding or a change in development plans, and whether or not such work can be considered contractually owned by the individual/corporation that originally paid for the work, and whether archaeologists have sufficient legal basis to ensure that even cancelled project reports and/or data must be filed with at least their respective state archaeological site files office.

We have seen the impact of section 106 of NHPA as a commercial enterprise, and I acknowledge that the federal government was and is unprepared to meet the ongoing challenge of 106 without private sector assistance. But I fear that ARPA and NAGPRA will become a ""cash cow"" for some archeologists. While I support fully our legal system's due process, those cases in which I have been involved showed a lack of concern on the part of archeologists working for the defense for substantive efforts in their side of case management. In other words, it looks to me like they are just out for the money. Attacking in court a Damage Assessment document prepared by a federal or Indian archeologist is, I suppose, fair game, but the notion that archeologists may find a source of income from this troubles me greatly and I firmly believe that it falls into the category of ""unethical."" ",Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Agree,"ARPA requires, where possible, the determination of Commercial Value defined in the Act as the ""fair market value"" of the objects (in the condition prior to the commission of the prohibited acts). The tribes with whom I routinely work understand this, although they find it alien and insulting. But where human remains and other ""NAGPRA items"" are concerned it reaches another level. Placing a commercial value on human remains should be avoided at all costs. I have sought and obtained letters of support for this which I include in Damage Assessment documents where appropriate. Perhaps some specific language regarding the higher level of concern for human remains and other items as defined by NAGPRA would be beneficial to this statement. ",Strongly Agree,,Agree,"For me, the operative phrase is ""no legal restrictions"". The dissemination of this knowledge is essential if archeology is to grow. However, there must be careful consideration as to the consequences of sharing information. Even at the state level my interaction as a federal archeologist was hampered by their insistence that site location data would be shared (gotta get that trinomial, right?), but that the information would then be available on the state's internet for researchers and contractors. I insisted that unless the state would provide a firewall and involve me as the person directly responsible for what is otherwise unavailable information, even under a FOIA, I would not share data. I felt that I had the responsibility to know, and approve, of who was requesting access to this information. My bureau requested this three years in a  row and got no response from the state archeological survey.",Agree,"Use of reporting formats that lend themselves to easy redaction of specific site location information is a good practice.  I'm not fooling myself thinking that the looters don't know more than we do, but we still have to do the right thing. Sadly, in my former bureau (NPS), there was a system in place that classified all reports as to three categories: available, available with redactions, and restricted. When or why that went by the board is unknown to me and I look with horror at my own reports available on-line on Amazon or Bookfinders.com that reflect years of careful survey and reporting, now made easy pickings for looters. ",Strongly Agree,"There are some disquieting things going on in the world of curation. Theft of museum property is a big one and I have  initiated a task group to address the underdeveloped nexus between Curation and ARPA. In another area, some federal agencies (USACOE in particular) is restricting collection of artifacts (including diagnostics) on the part of its contractors in order to avoid curatorial costs. I get not bringing in another truckload of metates, but the importance of long-term curation is in jeopardy with this sort of action. Also, I question the quality of ""analysis"" that goes on in the field under a restriction like this. There are also legal questions associated: If there is a decision to not proceed with a phase 2 or phase 3 level of action, how can it be verified if questioned?

3) Honoring the legal and cultural values, in the United States, that privilege private property rights over public rights.
4) Developing and implementing triage criteria in the preservation, recovery, analysis, and interpretation of cultural resources information in the face of cultural resources destruction by development.",Agree,"My only hesitations are that 1) ""avoidance"" (in situ preservation by deferring action) is not always preservation, and that natural processes should be considered in the inherent loss of information through time; 2) We are increasingly confronted with the issue that ""for the benefit of all people"" is not a cultural universal, and that some descendant communities have a vested interest in histories that cannot be confirmed (and in some cases are denied) by archaeological investigations; and 3) there is a difficult-to-negotiate line by pandering to voyeurism in building public support for stewardship and considering the interests of descendant communities (often we, as archaeologists, are less sensitive to the derivation of our own values from a Euroamerican cultural value system).",Agree,"This touches the conflict between public (majority) interests and affected (minority) interests, usually of descendant communities. The ""goal of establishing a working relationship"" presupposes that all descendant communities want a working relationship, which may not be the case for reasons that are unrelated to archaeology and that are part of the overall ""colonial trauma.""",Agree,"There is no question that I agree with this principle, but on several occasions I have been asked by collectors to look at objects with their goal of my informally validating ""authenticity."" These identification activities have occasionally revealed that what they have inherited or purchased are actually clever forgeries. In two cases, my assessments have actually stopped the individuals from participating further in the antiquities trade because it demonstrated both their lack of judgment and the lack ethics on the part of the sellers. This is where, as a contract archaeologist in a museum setting, there is a public obligation to educate, while adhering strictly to the museum policy that prevents formal authentication or valuation.",Strongly Agree,"If the public is not convinced of the value of knowledge derived through archaeology, then cultural resource preservation (law and regulation) will disappear. Stewardship is the usual focus of SAA (and academic) educational programming, and I would not diminish that. However, there is a far more fertile message moving into the future, which would be the use of examples from past human history to increase understanding of basic principles of human ecology: climate change, demography, economy, social structure. Our education program also has a dimension which has been increasing embraced by descendant communities where instead of telling them their own histories, we provide access to technologies that can have an important role in modern cultural practice but that were lost during the formal government and education policies of acculturation to Euroamerican values. Also, we find that the archaeological community in a corporate sense feels no responsibility to support educational programming unless they see a narrowly defined corporate benefit. In my organization, we have the advantage of developing long term (30+ year) relationships with descendant communities and individuals, and that seems to be non-existent in for-profit contract archaeology.",Strongly Agree,"Agreement, but with several twists ... As a State entity within a museum system, all of our information (data) is treated as public record. Despite the challenge (risk) to our not-for-profit enterprise model, we try to find the time to answer all questions, whether from students, scholars, peers, the public, or tribes. In an extreme (and dysfunctional) extension of that responsibility, individuals (non-academic?) have misused the New Mexico ""Inspection of Public Records Act"" to force our office to do research for them that they could and should do for themselves. On the flip side, we have had tribes request the sequester of archaeological information, outside of any legal framework such as NAGPRA, where I am actually in fear that an Inspection of Public Records Act request will force me to violate the tribal request. Initial sequester requests have had a strong basis in cultural values, but increasingly we see sequester requests that appear to be based on sovereignty exercises, both as simply as an exercise of sovereign rights and as a means of damaging the cultural interests of other sovereigns.",Strongly Agree,"Our office, subject to confidentiality restrictions, makes all of our substantive documents accessible to the public through PDF downloads. The confidentiality restrictions are based on statute, regulation, and practice within New Mexico contract archaeology, and are widely adhered to.",Agree,"I am comfortable with our application of these principles in the Museum of New Mexico setting, but I am not comfortable that these principles are expressed in academic settings, both within archaeology but especially in multidisciplinary academic settings. An extreme example: The entire scientific legacy of Dr. Robert DuBois, the founder of archaeomagnetic dating in the western hemisphere, was slated to be disposed of in the landfill in Oklahoma City by the geophysics department and by his heirs. I became aware of the situation, and I was given two weeks to act. I was able to get a donor to provide funds for a moving truck, and I and two volunteers ended up rescuing 6 tons of samples, records, and equipment from destruction. Now that legacy is being prepared for use by the geophysics community as part of their world-wide modeling of the earth's magnetic field, but I have yet to see expressions of interest from the archaeological community ... we'll see.",Agree,"We try to adhere to these principles, but there are notable cases in CRM where ""low bid"" or corporate connections have resulted in underqualified individuals pursuing both the field archaeology and analytic studies associated with projects. The only examples that come to mind are self-serving, but are nonetheless appropriate. Arizona-trained archaeologists trying to apply pottery typologies that they think are relevant but aren't in the analysis of New Mexico pottery collections, resulting in the inability of the data to contribution to regional questions of culture history. Also, Four Corners trained and experienced archaeologist applying well-established Four Corners interpretative models in settings where they are inappropriate (""Ancestral Puebloan"" masks the need to create at least four completely distinct culture  histories from before the advent of pottery in the Southwest), resulting in the failure to perceive (in the data!) important variability.",Strongly Agree,"This is incredibly important, but it has been a work in progress.

The SAA has one award named for a known sexual predator ... but I haven't seen any will to undo the situation.",Strongly Agree,"Yes, but there can be productive dialogs and conflicts that may not have adequate resolutions. Underlying this is the leveraging of culture histories to reflect sovereign interests, which in some senses is a fair play turnabout, in that early archaeology was built on the cultural need for Euroamericans to assert a cultural superiority over non-European peoples. I can't stress enough the importance of ensuring strong anthropological training for all archaeologists.",Agree,"A aspect of archaeology, especially public education and outreach, needs to focus on human ecology as an antidote to the resurgence of a bigoted movement toward ""American Exceptionalism.""

I see competition, the lack of valuation of regional expertise, unprepared agency archaeologists who move to areas of in-expertise, and regulatory powers that are at best exercised on the front end of projects with no power on the back end of data and interpretive products.

Gender bias, which is still a considerable problem. I hear things about female students and faculty all the time that sound like something from the 1950s. Hiring bias is still a problem. Bias in grant proposals and reviews still exists. Many times in grant meetings I hear that the proposal needs to be sent to ""Bill, Ted, Fred, and Joe"" for review. And I say: ""Mary, Jane, Sue, and Anne would also be excellent reviewers."" And people say, ""Oh, yes, them too."" Females, even highly accomplished ones, are often an afterthought.

Lack of mentorship for graduate students and poor preparation for a variety of careers. Too many faculty see that the only ""real"" job is a tenure-track one, and even *years* after their former students have become successful in a variety of careers the faculty mentor will let out a deep sigh about how it was ""too bad"" that so-and-so ""never got a job"" as if the only worthwhile job is in an R1 (full disclosure: I teach in an R1, and often find myself to be the only faculty member who is willing to proactively talk to grad students about job variety).
