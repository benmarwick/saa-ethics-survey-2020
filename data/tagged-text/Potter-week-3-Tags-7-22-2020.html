    <p>Neocolonialism and collaboration are not addressed in any way. Archaeological practice should not perpetuate inequalities, and it should be acknowledged that there is no one correct way to interpret the past. Also, consequences for members who commit harassment or assault should be explicitly stated</p>

    <p>The language emphasizes rule following. It reads like a legal contract. As a series of principles, it‚Äôs not exactly inspiring of ethical conduct. None of them are wrong but neither are they something a trainee would turn to for a clear, resounding idea of what ethical archaeology looks like</p>

    <p>Archaeologists have often developed a bad reputation with Native Americans and other descendant groups, whose ancestors created the archaeological record that we study. Archaeologists have benefited financially and intellectually from the study of this record, often at the expense of these groups, either through the loss of resources or other economic losses, or their patrimony. There needs to be a principle that specifically recognizes the interests of Native Americans and other descendant groups and the responsibility of archaeologists to give back to the members of these groups through such means as employment, training, and capacity building to empower these people to become better and more knowledgeable stewards of their own heritage.</p>

    <p>I would add somewhere that we are also responsible for the health and safety of the communities in which we work. This has become an issue right now, as I consider whether to bring a crew into an area to conduct excavations. I am responsible not only for the health and safety of the people I bring, I also have a responsibility not to affect negatively the health and safety of the community by, say, introducing a virus</p>

    <p>I think there needs to be more attention to community-based archaeology and archaeology that works with descendent communities. In that vein, I think more attention needs to be given to the specifically colonial and postcolonial political contexts that archaeology is conducted within.</p>

    <p>As it stands, the Principles of Ethics normalizes archaeologists as the natural proprietors of the archaeological record - a state of affairs solidified in the 1906 American Antiquities Act as it classified Indigenous remains as national heritage - in a way that obscures the more complex and contested politics of who owns the past.</p>

    <p>I would take the review of the Principles of Ethics as an opportunity to frame a system of ethics for creating a discipline and practice of archaeology that better serves marginalized and historically underrepresented communities. For example, archaeology is not an especially diverse field - and I think we have an ethical responsibility to look at the systematic mechanisms that reproduce that situation and change them.</p>

    <p>This is a bit beside the point but I feel that the SAA should advocate public outreach for academic archaeologists. There are many non-profits and other organizations that do a lot of good outreach and public education but many academic archaeologists get little to no credit for outreach work that they do (and it‚Äôs sometimes even discouraged when on the tenure track). If the SAA could make a strong statement that it was part of the obligation of all archaeologists to make efforts toward public outreach, this might help sway some universities to value such activities more.</p>

    <p>This principle should be called Public education and community engagement rather than outreach, as outreach denotes a unidirectional hierarchical relationship. Ethical principles should encourage archaeologists to also learn from the communities and integrate their knowledge into the research. While we can teach about archaeology, we can also certainly do a better job learning the worldviews of those connected to the pasts we are researching. These relationships should be balanced, representing ‚Äòbraided knowledge‚Äô rather than hierarchical knowledge with archaeologists on top</p>

    <p>Often archaeological interpretations can be upsetting to descendant groups, and can encourage forms of oppression (e.g. "this culture was violent" can encourage or justify oppression because a government could claim they are protecting the people from a violent culture. So when other interpretations become available to help descendant groups make sense of their past, it is important that emerging archaeologists can publish those data and educate about new interpretations without fearing that their career will be ruined by older archaeologists who they are contradicting</p>
