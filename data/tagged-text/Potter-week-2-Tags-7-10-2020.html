    <p>Further archaeologists should work to educate the public at large on why the artifact alone is lacking in significance to reduce the number of "buyers" an item may have, and partner WITH avocational archaeologists to teach them the value of research and data collection to at least diminish the destruction of that info and for them to act as educator advocates to others who may sell artifacts</p>

    <p>‚ÄúI agree with this statement, particularly as it relates to objects of cultural patrimony that are belong to a group that is not that of the archaeologist</p>

    <p>This principle statement glosses over the fact that many looted "art" objects are burial goods that are sacred or hold special importance to descendant communities and that their procurement has resulted ‚Äî and in many cases continues to result ‚Äî in the destruction and desecration of human burials. </p>

    <p>The SAA should take a stronger ethical stance against the study and publication of looted objects and should advocate for the repatriation of burial goods and other objects of indigenous cultural patrimony ‚Äî both privately held ones and those that are part of museum collections</p>

    <p> Affiliation with terrorist groups and the law enforcement component is so important. So many advances have been made in archaeologists working with law enforcement, training in what to look for, long term participation in investigations that uncover small and large scale operations.</p>

    <p>It is unclear as to whether the SAA is against this because of the implicated destruction of archaeological sites or an otherwise unmentioned negative implication on descent groups and others that claim a connection to archaeological heritage and associated material culture</p>

    <p>we might benefit from some examples. Is it ethical to identify artifacts posted on a FB page full of looters? Is that different from holding artifact identification days at your local museum?</p>

    <p>This is an important statement - but is something I was never taught in my studies of archaeology, from BA to MA to PHD. I have never heard a colleague talk about a time when they did this (chose not to do a project because of commercial impact). I have heard many more stories, both in the US and abroad, where armed guards were hired to protect sites because of valuable objects (or rumors of valuable objects)</p>

    <p>t should be recognized that the very work of archaeology increases the commercial value of archaeological objects. There is currently an issue with metal detector looting and the "magnet fishing" looting of underwater sites.</p>
